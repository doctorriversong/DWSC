It's 1207.
I've got half past three. Am I phoning a different time zone?
Yeah, you really sort of are.
Will it show up on the bill?
Oh, I dread to think. Listen, where did you get this number?
The woman in the shop wrote it down.
It's a help line, isn't it? She said it's the best help line out there. In the universe, she said.
What woman? Who was she?
I don't know. The woman in the shop. So why isn't there internet? Shouldn't it sort of be there?
Look, listen, I'm not actually, it isn't. You have clicked on the WiFi button, yeah?
Hang on. WiFi.
Click on the WiFi, you'll see a list of names. You see one you recognise.
It's asking me for a password.
Is it okay if I go and see Nina? You can call her mum.
Sure. What's the password for the internet?
R Y C B A R 1 2 3.
How am I supposed to remember that?
Is it an evil spirit?
A woman.
Hang on.
A mo. Run you clever boy and remember one two three.
What did you say?
Don't shout. Now you've made me type it wrong. It's thrown me out again. What do I do? How do I get back in?
It's just a thing to remember the password, run you clever boy and remember. Hang on.
Hello? Yes, I hear you.
Yep. Ah ha.
Hello.
Clara. Clara Oswald.
Hello
Clara Oswin Oswald.
Just Clara Oswald. What was that middle one?
Do you remember me?
No. Should I? Who are you?
The Doctor. No? The Doctor?
Doctor who?
No, just the Doctor. Actually, sorry, could you start all that again?
Could I what?
Could you just ask me that question again?
Doctor who?
Okay, just once more.
Doctor who?!
Ooo, yeah. Ooo. Do you know, I never realised how much I enjoy hearing that said out loud. Thank you.
Okay.
Hey, no, Clara, please. Clara, I need to talk to you. Listen. Please.
Clara Oswald. We've got a positive lock on her, but I think she's borderline. Very clever but no computer skills.
Upload her anyway. Splice her a computer skills package.
I'll activate a spoonhead.
Alexei, we call them servers, not spoonheads.
Sorry. Excuse me.
I'm ever so fond of Alexei, but my conscience says we should probably kill him.
I'll inform HR.
Actually, he's about to go on holiday. Kill him when he gets back. Let's not be unreasonable.
Didn't you want to speak to me?
We're uploading too many people too quickly. We're going to get noticed.
If your conscience is bothering you, think of it like this. We're preserving living minds in permanent form in the data cloud. It's like immortality, only fatal.
My conscience is fine.
Good. Because our client has his needs.
Did you just hack me?
Because you changed your mind?
I hope I did.
Please, I just need to speak to you.
Why are you still here? Why are you here at all?
Oi, you phoned me. You were looking for the internet.
That was you?
Of course it was me.
How did you get here so fast?
I just happened to be in the neighbourhood, on my mobile phone.
When you say mobile phone, why do you point at that blue box?
Because it's a surprisingly accurate description.
Okay, we're finished now.
Oi, no, don't.
Angie? Angie, you upstairs? Angie, you still here?
Hello.
Hello
Are you a friend of Angie's?
I'm a friend of Angie's.
What were you doing upstairs?
I was upstairs.
I know you, don't I?
You know me, don't you.
Right. Don't be a monk. Monks are not cool.
Ah ha! Clara! Clara?
Hello?
Ah, see? Look, it's me. De-monked. Sensible clothes. Can I come in now?
I don't understand.
You just open the door.
I don't know.
Of course you can.
Where I am. I don't know where I am. Where am I? Please tell me where I am. I don't know where I am.
I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am!
Clara? Clara?
I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am. I don't understand. I don't know where I am! I don't understand. I don't know where I am.
Where am I? I don't know where I am.
I've got a problem.
Walking base station. Walking WiFi base station. Hoovering up data. Hoovering up people.
Oh no, you don't.
Looks like someone is trying to reverse an upload.
Is that possible?
The upload isn't fully integrated yet. In theory, yes.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not this time, Clara, I promise.
Can you stop this?
No.
Okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're fine. You're back. Yes, you are. Oh yes, you are.
Well?
Our hacker sent a message.
[UNDER MY PROTECTION - The Doctor.]
I assume he's talking about the girl.
Get out. I have to speak to the client.
Sir. The one you told me about, he's here. The Doctor is here.
Hello?
Hello! Are you all right?
I'm in bed.
Yes.
Don't remember going.
No.
What did I miss?
Oh, quite a lot, actually. Angie called. She's going to stay over at Nina's. Apparently that's all completely fine and you shouldn't worry like you always do. For God's sake get off her back.
Also, your dad phoned, mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them, I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it.
I fixed that rattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards, optimised photosynthesis in the main flower bed and assembled a quadricycle.
Assembled a what?
I found a disassembled quadricycle in the garage.
I don't think you did.
I invented the quadricycle. Ha!
What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
I was scared, really scared. Didn't know where I was.
Do you know now?
Yes.
Well then, you should go to sleep. Because you're safe now, I promise. Goodnight, Clara.
Are you guarding me?
Well, yes. Yes, I am.
Are you seriously going to sit down there all night?
I promise I won't budge from this spot.
Well then, I'll have to come to you.
Eh?
I take it the girl's inside, and alive?
Yes.
Alexei, I need you to do something creative about that.
I like your house.
It isn't mine. I'm a friend of the family.
But you look after the kids. Oh yes, you're a governess, aren't you, just like…
Just like what?
Just like. I thought you probably would be.
Are you going to explain what happened to me?
There's something in the wifi.
Okay.
This whole world is swimming in WiFi. We're living in a WiFi soup. Suppose something got inside it. Suppose there was something living in the WiFi , harvesting human minds. Extracting them.
Imagine that. Human souls trapped like flies in the world-wide web. Stuck forever, crying out for help.
Isn't that basically Twitter?
What's that face for?
A computer can hack another computer. A living, sentient computer, maybe that could hack people. Edit them. Re-write them.
Why would you say that?
Because a few hours ago you knew nothing about the internet, and you just made a joke about Twitter.
Oh. Oh, that's weird. I know all about computers now in my head. Where did all that come from?
You were uploaded for a while. Wherever you were, you brought something extra back, which I very much doubt you'll be allowed to keep.
You and me inside that box, now.
I'm sorry?
Look, just get inside.
Both of us?
Oh, trust me. You'll understand once we're in there.
I bet I will. What is that box, anyway? Why have you got a box? Is it like a snogging booth?
Clara. A what?
Is that what you do, bring a booth? There is such a thing as too keen.
Clara, look around you.
What's going on? What's happening? Is the wifi switching on the lights?
No, people are switching on the lights. The wifi is switching on the people.
What is that thing?
A walking base station. You saw one earlier.
I saw a little girl.
It must have taken an image from your subconscious, thrown it back at you. Ah! Active camouflage. They could be everywhere.
Doctor? Doctor. What's going on?
Do we need another London-wide activation? We can't always pass it off as a riot.
Our lights are on and everyone else's off. Why?
Some planes have WiFi.
I'm sorry?
We must be one hell of a target right now.
You, me, box, right now.
Yes, it's a spaceship. Yes, it's bigger on the inside. Now, I don't have time to talk about it.
But, but, but, but it's…
Shut up, please. Short hops are difficult.
Bigger on the inside. Actually bigger.
Right, come on.
We're going to go back out there?
We've moved. It's a spaceship. We flew away.
Away from the plane?
Not exactly.
How did we get here?
It's a ship. I told you. It's all very science-y.
This is the plane? The actual plane? Are they all dead?
Asleep. Switched off by the WiFi. Never mind them.
What is going on? Is this real? Please, tell me what is happening!
I'm the Doctor. I'm an alien from outer space. I'm a thousand years old, I've got two hearts and I can't fly a plane! Can you?
No.
Oh, fine. Let's do it together.
Whoo! Would a victory roll be too showy offy?
What the hell's going on?
Well, I'm blocking your WiFi so you're waking up, for a start. Tell you what, do you want to drive?
I don't understand. That box, where's it gone? Find that box!
Okay. When are you going to explain to me what the hell is going on?
Breakfast.
What? I ain't waiting till breakfast.
It's a time machine. You never have to wait for breakfast.
Thank you, thank you. Yes, magic blue box.
All donations gratefully accepted. Roll up, give us your dosh. Pennies, pounds, anything you've got.
Keep collecting. We need enough for breakfast. Just popping back to the garage.
Garage?
This way.
So this is tomorrow, then. Tomorrow's come early.
No, it came at the usual time. We just took a short cut. Thank you, thank you. Tomorrow, a camel.
What's happening?
Blue box, South bank. Definitely wasn't there five minutes ago.
Are we sure this time? Earl's Court was an embarrassment.
If you've got a flying time machine, why are we on a motorbike?
I don't take the TARDIS into battle.
Because it's made of wood?
Because it's the most powerful ship in the universe and I don't want it falling into the wrong hands. Okay?
I do love London. So many cameras.
So if we can travel anywhere in time and space, why did we travel to the morning. What's the point in that?
Whoever's after us spent the whole night looking for us. Are you tired?
Yes.
What? Then imagine how they feel. They came the long way round. They've got to be close. Definitely London going by the signal distribution. I can hack the lowest level of their operating system but I can't establish a physical location. The security's too good.
Are you an alien?
I am. Yes, okay with that?
Oh, yeah. Think I'm fine.
Oh, good.
So, what happens if you do find them? What happens then?
I don't know. I can't tell the future, I just work there.
You don't have a plan?
Oh, you know what I always say about plans.
What?
I don't have one.
People always have plans.
Yes. Yes, I suppose they do. So tell me, how long have you been looking after those kids?
About a year, since their mum died.
Okay. Why you? Family friend, I get that, but there must have been others. Why did it have to be you? You don't really seem like a nanny.
Gimme.
Sorry. What?
You need to know where they physically are. Their exact location.
Yes.
I can do it.
Oi, hang on. I need that.
You've hacked the lower operating system, yeah? I'll have their physical location in under five minutes. Pop off and get us a coffee.
If I can't find them, you definitely can't.
They uploaded me, remember? I've got computing stuff in my head.
So do I.
I have insane hacking skills.
I'm from space and the future with two hearts and twenty seven brains.
And I can find them in under five minutes plus photographs. Twenty seven?
Okay, slight exaggeration.
Coffee, go get. Five minutes, I promise.
The security is absolute.
It's never about the security, it's about the people.
Why do you keep looking at me like that?
Sorry, no, it's nothing. It's just, you're a nanny. Isn't that a bit, well, Victorian?
Victorian?
You're young. Shouldn't you be doing, you know, young things, with young people?
You mean like you, for instance? Down, boy.
No. No. I didn't. Shut up.
Two more cappuccinos over there, please.
One moment, sir.
You realise you haven't the slightest chance of saving your little friend.
I'm sorry, what?
One moment, sir. I said, there's not the slightest chance of saving your little friend. And don't annoy the old man. He isn't, in fact, speaking.
I'm speaking. Just using whatever's to hand.
Oh, she's rather pretty, isn't she? Do you like her?
Make her like you, too, if you want. You all right, sir?
Er, yes. Yes. Fine.
You okay?
Sure. Setting up stuff. Need a user name.
Learning fast.
Clara Oswald for the win. Oswin!
You can always call me Oswin, seeing as that's my name.
Now I want you to take a look around. Go on, have a little stroll.
And see how impossible your situation is.
Go on, take a look. I do love showing off.
Just let me show you what control of the wifi can do for you. Stop!
I saw what you can do last night.
And clear.
We can hack anyone in the wifi once they've been exposed long enough.
So there's one of your walking base stations here, somewhere close.
There's always someone close. We've released thousands into the world.
They home in on the wifi like rats sniffing cheese.
There's something up with the webcams.
I don't know who you are or why you're doing this, but the people of this world will not be harmed. They will not controlled. They will not be
The people of this world are…
In no danger whatsoever. My client requires a steady diet of living human minds. Healthy, free-range, human minds. He loves and cares for humanity. In fact, he can't get enough of it.
It's obscene. It's murder.
It's life.
The farmer tends his flock like a loving parent.
The abattoir is not a contradiction.
No one loves cattle more than Burger King.
I'm sure of it. Someone's hacking the webcams. All of them.
Everybody check your webcams.
But what would be the point, taking mug shots of us?
Who's on Facebook?
Bebo? MySpace? Abo?
Put your hands down if you didn't mention where you work.
This ends. I'm going to end this today.
How? You don't even know…
Where we are.
Who's doing this? Who is your client? Hmm? Answer me.
Miss Kizlet, we have a problem.
I did it. I really did. I did it. I did it. I found them.
You found them.
The Shard. They're in the Shard. Floor sixty five.
Floor sixty five.
Are you listening to me, Doctor? I found them.
I'm listening to you. You found them.
We've got her. This time we've really got her.
Clara? Clara?
Doctor? Doctor, help me. I, I don't know where I am. I don't understand. Doctor, help me, please. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am! I don't know where I am. Doctor, please. Please help me. Please help me. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am.
Doctor, help me. I don't know where I am.
Should we pulp her or keep her as a hostage?
There's no point. She's fully integrated now. She can't be downloaded again. I'm sure he knows that.
I'm not sure he does. He's coming.
We could stop him, I suppose.
Why bother? Could be quite funny.
Really, Doctor. A motorbike? Hardly seems like you.
I rode this in the antigrav Olympics, 2074. I came last.
The building is in lock-down. I'm afraid you're not coming in.
Did you even hear the word, antigrav?
Seriously? He can do that? He can really actually do that?
Oh dear lord.
I think that was your office.
Excuse me. I believe there's someone to see me.
Do come in.
Download her.
Sorry about the draught.
Download her back into her body right now.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
She's a fully integrated part of the data cloud, now. She can't be separated.
Then download the entire cloud. Everyone you've trapped in there.
You realise what would happen?
Yes, those with bodies to go home to would be free.
A tiny number. Most would simply die.
They'd be released from a living hell. It's the best you can do for them, so give the order.
And why would I do that?
Because I'm going to motivate you, any second now.
You ridiculous man. Why did you even come here? Whatever for?
I didn't.
What?
I'm still in the cafe. I'm finishing my coffee. Lovely spot.
You hack people, but me?
I'm old-fashioned.
I hack technology.
Here's your motivation.
No, not me! Not me!
Put me back. Put me back! Download me at once! That is an order. That is an order!
But she's fully integrated now. We'll have to download the entire cloud. We can't do that.
No, we can't.
Download me! Download me!
Do what she says.
Doctor?
Doctor? Doctor!
You have no right to be in this office, and I am demanding that you leave at once.
This building is under UNIT control.
What is UNIT? Never heard of you.
Just you calm down, sir.
UNIT are here. Friends of the Doctor, I presume.
Oh, old friends. Very old friends.
Then I appear to have failed you, Great Intelligence.
I have feasted on many minds. I have grown. But now it is time for you to reduce.
You've been whispering in my ear so long, I'm not sure I remember what I was before.
Goodbye, Miss Kizlet.
Sorry. Where am I? What am I doing here? Are you soldiers? What's happening? How did I get here?
Excuse me, where are the toilets?
The toilets?
I'm here to fix the toilets, the gents. How long have I been here?
Stay where you are!
Ma'am, identify yourself.
Where are my mummy and daddy? They said they wouldn't be long. Are they coming back?
Come in.
So, he comes back, does he?
You didn't answer my question.
What question?
You don't seem like a nanny.
I was going to travel. I came to stay for a week before I left, and during that week…
She died, so you're returning the favour. You've got a hundred and one places to see, and you haven't been to any of them, have you? That's why you keep the book.
I keep the book because I'm still going.
But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I was more like that. You know, the thing about a time machine, you can run away all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do you say? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors.
Does this work?
Eh?
Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger and people just jump in your snog box and fly away?
It is not a snog box.
I'll be the judge of that.
Starting when?
Come back tomorrow. Ask me again.
Why?
Because tomorrow, I might say yes. Sometime after seven okay for you?
It's a time machine. Any time's okay.
See you then.
Clara? In your book there was a leaf. Why?
That wasn't a leaf. That was page one.
Right then, Clara Oswald. Time to find out who you are.
"""THE RINGS OF AKHATEN""
6 April 2013 — 07x07
—written by Neil Cross"
Oh, my stars. Are you all right?
Yeah.
So, I've got something for you.
What?
You kept it?
Of course I kept it.
Why?
Because this exact leaf had to grow in that exact way in that exact place so that precise wind could tear it from that precise branch and make it fly into this exact face at that exact moment.
And if just one of those tiny little things had never happened, I'd never have met you. Which makes this the most important leaf in human history.
Give it a kick.
Oh, my stars! Are you all right?
Fine. Marvellous. Refulgent. Possibly a bit embarrassed. That's not dangerous, is it?
What's not?
Embarrassment.
Not usually. Not to my knowledge.
Good. Hey. Phew.
Mate, I'm so sorry. She wants to be Bryan Robson.
No worries. My fault. No harm done. Hello there.
Clara.
Ah. Hello there, Clara.
She's just a girl. How can she be?
She can't be. She is. She can't be. She's not possible.
So we're moving through actual time? So what's it made of, time? I mean, if you can just rotor through it, it's got to be made of stuff, like jam's made of strawberries. So what's it made of?
Well, not strawberries. No. No, no, no. That would be unacceptable.
And we can go anywhere?
Within reason. Well, I say reason.
So, we could go backwards in time.
And space, yes.
And forwards in time.
And space. Totally. So, where do you want to go, eh? What do you want to see?
I don't know. You know when someone asks you what's your favourite book and straight away you forget every single book that you've ever read?
No. Totally not.
Well, that's a thing that happens.
And? Back to the question?
Okay. So. So. So. So I'd like to see. I would like to see. What I would like to see is, something awesome.
Can you feel the light on your eyelids? That is the light of an alien sun. Forward a couple of steps. Okay. Are you ready?
Yes. No. Yes.
Welcome to the Rings of Akhaten.
It's…
It is. It so completely is. But wait, there is more.
More what?
Wait, wait, wait.
In about five, four, three, two…
What is it?
The Pyramid of the Rings of Akhaten. It's a holy site for the Sun Singers of Akhat.
The who of what?
Seven worlds orbiting the same star. All of them sharing a belief that life in the universe originated here, on that planet.
All life?
In the universe.
Did it?
Well, it's what they believe. It's a nice story.
Can we see it? Up close?
Where are they from?
Oh, you know, the local system, mostly.
What do I call them?
Well, let's see. Ah! There go some Panbabylonians. A Lugal-Irra-Kush. Some Lucanians. A Hooloovoo. Ah! Qom VoTivig.
That chap's a Terraberserker of the Kodion Belt. You don't see many of them around any more. Oh! That's an Ultramancer. Do you know, I forget how much I like it here. We should come here more often.
You've been here before?
Yes, yes, yes. I came here a long time ago with my granddaughter.
Hang on!
Exotic fruit of some description. Right. Non-toxic, non-hallucinogenic. High in free radicals and low in other stuff, I shouldn't wonder.
No?
So, why is everyone here?
For the Festival of Offerings. Takes place every thousand years or so, when the rings align. It's quite a big thing, locally, like Pancake Tuesday.
Oh! Er, Doctor?
What's happening? Why is it angry?
This isn't an it, it's a she. Dor'een, meet Clara. Clara, meet Dor'een.
Doreen?
Loose translation. She sounds a bit grumpy but she's a total love actually, aren't you? Yes, you are. No, actually, she's just asking if we fancy renting a moped.
So, how much does it cost?
Not money. Something valuable. Sentimental value. A photograph, love letter, something like that. That's what's used for currency here. Psychometry. Objects psychically imprinted with their history. The more treasured they are, the more value they hold.
That's horrible.
Better than using bits of paper.
Then you pay.
With what?
You're a thousand years old. You must have something you care about.
Doctor? Doctor?
Are you okay?
Have you seen her?
Who?
The Queen of Years.
Who?!
Hello?
Hey. Are you okay? Are you lost?
Are you all right? What are you doing?
Hiding.
Oh. Why?
You don't know me?
Sorry. Actually not.
So why did you follow me?
To help. You looked lost.
I don't believe you.
I've got no idea who you might be. I've never been here before. I've never been anywhere like here before. I just saw a little girl who looked like she needed help.
Really?
Really really.
Can you help me?
That's why I'm still here.
Because I need to hide.
Merry. Where are you, Merry?
I know the perfect box.
Merry, where are you? Merry. Merry.
What's this?
A space-shippy thing. Timey, spacey.
It's teeny.
You wait.
Oh, come on.
What's wrong?
I don't know. I don't think it likes me. Come on, let me in.
Hey. Hey, little girl.
My name's Merry.
So, what's happening? Is someone trying to hurt you?
No. I'm just scared.
Of what?
Getting it wrong.
Okay. Can you pretend like I'm totally a space alien and explain?
I'm Merry Gejelh.
Really not local. Sorry.
The Queen of Years? They chose me when I was a baby, the day the last Queen of Years died.
Okay.
I'm the vessel of our history. I know every chronicle, every poem, every legend, every song.
Every single one? Blimey. I hated history.
And now I have to sing a song in front of everyone. A special song. I have to sing it to a god. And I'm really scared.
Everyone's scared when they're little. I used to be terrified of getting lost. Used to have nightmares about it. And then I got lost. Blackpool beach, Bank holiday Monday, about ten billion people. I was about six. My worst nightmare come true.
What happened?
The world ended. My heart broke. And then my mum found me. We had fish and chips, and she drove me home and she tucked me up and she told me a story.
It doesn't matter where you are, in the jungle or the desert or on the moon. However lost you may feel, you'll never really be lost. Not really. Because I will always be here, and I will always come and find you. Every single time. Every single time.
And you were never scared again?
Oh, I was scared lots of times, but never of being lost. So, this special song. What are you scared of, exactly?
Getting it wrong. Making Grandfather angry.
And do you think you'll get it wrong? Because I don't. I don't think you'll get it wrong. I think you, Merry Gejelh, will get it very, very right.
What have you been doing?
Exploring. Where are we going now?
Sleep, my precious, sleep. Lay down, my warrior. Rest now, my king.
Shush, shush. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry, sorry.
Are we even supposed to be here?
Shush.
But are we?
Shush! Sorry.
Akhaten…
Lay down, my king. Sleep now eternal. Sleep, my precious king. Lay down.
O god of Akhaten
They're singing to the Mummy in the Temple. They call it the Old God. Sometimes Grandfather.
O god of Akhaten…
What are they singing?
The Long Song. A lullaby without end to feed the Old God. Keep him asleep. It's been going for millions of years, chorister handing over to chorister, generation after generation after generation.
What are they doing?
Those are offerings. Gifts of value. Mementoes to feed the Old God.
O god of, O god of, O god of Akhaten.
Sleep, my precious king.
Lay, lay down.
Old God, protect us. Old God, protect us.
Okay, what's happening? Is that supposed to happen?
Help!
Is somebody going to do something? Excuse me, is somebody going to help her?
Why are we walking away? We can't just walk away. This is my fault! I talked her into doing this.
Listen. There's one thing you need to know about travelling with me. Well, one thing apart from the blue box and the two hearts. We don't walk away.
I need something precious.
Well, you must have something. All the places you've seen, there must be something.
This. And I don't want to give it away, because it comes in handy.
You're a thousand years ole and that's it? Your spanner?
Screwdriver.
It's my mum's.
Merry!
Brakes! Brakes!
Okay, time to let go.
I can't.
Clara, you have to.
Why?
Because it really hurts.
Sorry.
Oh, that's interesting. A frequency modulated acoustic lock. The key changes ten million zillion squillion times a second.
Can you open it?
Technically, no. In reality, also no, but still, let's give it a stab.
Do not wake from slumber. Old God, never wake from slumber.
How can they just stand there and watch?
Because this is sacred ground.
And she's a child.
And he's a god. Well, he is to them, anyway.
Do not wake from slumber. Old God, do not wake from slumber. Rest your weary, holy head and cast our lives asunder. Do not wake from slumber.
I don't know what to do next. What happens?
Merry! Merry, hold on! We'll be there soon. Doctor?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, hello.
Hello what?
The sonic's locked on to the acoustic tumblers.
Meaning?
Meaning I get to do this.
Hello there. I'm the Doctor, and you've met Clara. She was supposed to be having a nice day out. Still, it's early yet. Are you coming, then? Did I mention that the door is immensely heavy?
Leave. You'll wake him.
Really quite extraordinarily heavy.
Clara?
Old God, never wake from slumber.
Merry, we need to leave.
No. Go away.
Not without you.
You said I wouldn't get it wrong and then I got it wrong. And now this has happened. Look what happened!
You didn't get it wrong.
How do you know? You don't know anything. You have to go! Go now, or he'll eat us all.
Well, he's ugly. But you know, to be honest, I don't think he looks big enough.
Not our meat, our souls.
He doesn't want you. He wants me. If you don't leave, he'll eat you all up too.
Yes, and you don't want that, do you? You want us to walk out of this really quite astonishingly heavy door and never come back.
Yes.
I see. Right. Clara's right. Absolutely never going to happen.
Did you just lock us in with the soul eating monster?
Yep.
And is there actually a way to get out?
What? Before it eats our souls?
Ideally, yes.
Possibly. Probably. There usually seems to be.
Doctor, why is he still singing?
Old God, rest your weary, holy head.
He's trying to sing the Old God back to sleep, but that's not going to happen. He's waking up, mate. He's coming, ready or not. You want to run.
That's it, then. Song's over.
The song is over. My name is Chorister Rezh Baphix, and the Long Song ended with me.
That's it, then. Song's over.
Ah ha! Look at that.
You've woken him.
It's awake? What's it doing?
Oh, you know. Having a nice stretch.
No, we didn't wake him. And you didn't wake him, either. He's waking because it's his time to wake, and feed. On you, apparently. On your stories.
She didn't say stories. She said souls.
Same thing. The soul's made of stories, not atoms. Everything that ever happened to us. People we love, people we lost. People we found again against all the odds. He threatens to wake, they offer him a pure soul. The soul of the Queen of Years.
Stop it. You're scaring her.
Good. She should be scared. She's sacrificing herself. She should know what that means. Do you know what it means, Merry?
A god chose me.
It's not a god. It'll feed on your soul, but that doesn't make it a god. It is a vampire, and you don't need to give yourself to it. Hey, do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard.
All the elements in your body were forged many, many millions of years ago, in the heart of a far away star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space.
After so, so many millions of years, these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships and sealing wax, and cabbages and kings.
Until eventually, they came together to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only one Merry Gejelh. And there will never be another. Getting rid of that existence isn't a sacrifice. It is a waste.
So, if I don't, then everyone else…
Will be fine.
How?
There's always a way.
You promise?
Cross my hearts.
Having a nice stretch?
Something's coming.
The Vigil.
And what's the Vigil?
If the Queen of Years is unwilling to be feasted upon…
Yes?
It's their job to feed her to Grandfather.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't you dare.
Yeah, stay back. I'm armed. With a screwdriver.
Clara. Sonic.
You know all the stories. You must know if there's another way out.
There's a tale. A secret song. The Thief of the Temple and the Nimmer's Door.
And the secret songs open the secret door? How does it go? Can you sing it?
Go!
Doctor!
Where are you? Where are you?
Where did they go?
Grandfather's awake. They're of no function any more.
Well, you could sound happier about it.
Actually, I think I may have made a bit of a tactical boo-boo. More of a semantics mix-up, really.
What boo-boo?
I thought the Old God was Grandfather, but it wasn't. It was just Grandfather's alarm clock.
Sorry, a bit lost. Who's the Old God? Is there an Old God?
Unfortunately, yes.
Oh, my stars. What do we do?
Against that? I don't know. Do you know? I don't know. Any ideas?
But you promised. You promised!
I did. I did promise.
He'll eat us all. He'll spread across the system, consuming the Seven Worlds. And when there's no more to eat, he'll embark on a new odyssey among the stars.
I say leg it.
Leg it where, exactly?
Don't know. Lake District?
Oh, the Lake District's lovely. Let's definitely go there. We can eat scones. They do great scones in 1927.
You're going to fight it, aren't you.
Regrettably, yes. I think I may be about to do that.
It's really big.
I've seen bigger.
Really?
Are you joking? It's massive.
I'm staying with you.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am. I can assist.
No, you can't.
What about that stuff you said. We don't walk away.
No. We don't walk away. But when we're holding on to something precious, we run. We run and run as fast as we can and we don't stop running until we are out from under the shadow. Now, off you pop. Take the moped. I'll walk.
Any ideas? No, didn't think so. Righty-ho, then.
Lordy.
Isn't he frightened?
I think he is. I think he's very frightened.
I want to help.
So do I.
Rest now, my warrior. Rest now…
Okay, then. That's what I'll do. I'll tell you a story.
Please, wake up. And let the cloak of life cling to your bones.
Can you hear them? All these people who've lived in terror of you and your judgement? All these people whose ancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves, to you. Can you hear them singing?
Oh, you like to thing you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow.
So, come on, then. Take mine. Take my memories. But I hope you've got a big appetite, because I have lived a long life and I have seen a few things.
I walked away from the last Great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained. No time. No space. Just me.
I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a mad man. I've watched universes freeze and creations burn. I've seen things you wouldn't believe. I have lost things you will never understand.
And I know things. Secrets that must never be told. Knowledge that must never be spoken. Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze. So come on, then. Take it! Take it all, baby! Have it! You have it all!
Wake up. Wake up.
And I will always come and find you. Every single time.
We don't walk away.
Still hungry?
Well, I brought something for you. This. The most important leaf in human history. The most important leaf in human history.
It's full of stories, full of history. And full of a future that never got lived. Days that should have been that never were. Passed on to me.
This leaf isn't just the past, it's a whole future that never happened. There are billions and millions of unlived days for every day we live. An infinity. All the days that never came. And these are all my mum's.
Well, come on then. Eat up. Are you full? I expect so, because there's quite a difference, isn't there, between what was and what should have been. There's an awful lot of one, but there's an infinity of the other. And infinity's too much, even for your appetite.
Home again, home again, jiggity jig.
It looks different.
Nope. Same house, same city, same planet. Hey! Same day, actually. Not bad. Hole in one.
You were there. At mum's grave. You were watching. What were you doing there?
I don't know. I was just making sure.
Of what?
You remind me of someone.
Who?
Someone who died.
Well, whoever she was, I'm not her, okay? If you want me to travel with you, that's fine. But as me. I'm not a bargain basement stand-in for someone else. I'm not going to compete with a ghost.
No.
They wanted you to have it.
Who did?
Everyone. All the people you saved. You. No one else. Clara.
"""COLD WAR""
13 April 2013 — 07x08
—written by Mark Gatiss"
Signal is genuine. Signal is genuine. Zero bravo.
Prepare to launch nuclear weapons.
Aye, sir.
Moscow confirming launch sequence.
The Firebird stands ready to serve.
For the Motherland.
For the Motherland
This means nothing to me. This means nothing to me.
Oh, Vienna. Have I interrupted something?
We were about to blow up the world, Professor.
Again? Ultravox. I bloody love them. Got a friend who sends me the tapes.
This is the Captain. Drill abandoned. All hands, stand down. Repeat, drill abandoned.
With respect, sir, we must run it again.
Tomorrow.
Comrade Captain, the NATO exercises
Sabre rattling.
I don't think so.
Oh, you don't think so?
Sir, American aggression gets more intolerable by the day. We must run the drill again.
Tomorrow.
Did you have your specimen stowed okay?
Yeah. Piotr's looking after it.
Well, at least we have something to show for our little hunting expedition. What is it, a mammoth?
Probably.
What are you, milaya moya? Professor wants you thawed out back in Moscow, but life's too short to wait.
Argh! Get away!
Alarm! Alarm! Hold the bridge, port side.
Evasive manoeuvres!
Descending to two hundred metres.
We're under attack!
Two ten!
Bring her up! Bring her up!
It's no good, sir.
Viva Las Vegas!
Stranger on the bridge!
Who the hell are you?
Not Vegas, then.
No. No, this is much better.
A sinking submarine?
A sinking Soviet submarine!
Break out side arms. Restrain them!
Four ten. Four twenty. Turbines still not responding!
They've got to.
Ah! Sideways momentum. You've still got sideways momentum!
What?
Your propellers work independently of the main turbines. You can't stop her going down but you can manoeuvre the sub laterally. Do it!
Get these people off the bridge now!
Just listen to him, for god's sake!
Geographical anomaly to starboard. Probably an underwater ridge.
How do you know this?
Look, we have just a chance to stop the descent if we settle on it. Do it!
Six hundred metres. Sir, six ten!
Or this thing is going to implode.
Lateral thrust to starboard, all propellers.
Sir?
Now!
You're going to let this madman give the orders?
Lateral thrust!
Aye, sir! Six sixty, six eighty.
Descent arrested at seven hundred metres.
It seems we owe you are lives, whoever you are.
I'll hold you to that. Might come in handy.
Search them. Yes, I know. It's a woman. Now search them!
Are we going to be okay?
Oh, yes.
Is that a lie?
Possibly. Very dangerous time, Clara. East and West standing on the brink of nuclear oblivion.
Lots of itchy fingers on the button.
Isn't it always like that?
Sort of, but there are flash points and this is one. Hair, shoulder pads, nukes. It's the Eighties. Everything's bigger. I would like a receipt, please.
What is this?
Clara!
Doctor!
Clara!!
No! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, not now!
Captain, we didn't attack of your ship out here. Now we need to get the pumps working to get her afloat.
Yeah, we'll last till the rescue ship comes.
If it comes.
Oh, the sinking is just a coincidence, is it? Who are you?
All right, Captain, all right. You know what? Just this once, no dissembling, no psychic paper, no pretending to be an Earth Ambassador.
Doctor, me and Clara, time travellers. Clara, you okay?
Think so.
Time travellers?
We arrived here out of thin air. You just saw it happen.
I didn't.
Your problem, mate, not mine.
We were sinking.
Yes.
What happened?
We sank.
No, what happened to the TARDIS, I mean.
Never mind that. Listen. Captain, breath's precious down here. Let's not waste it, eh?
You're right. Maybe I can save a little oxygen by having you both shot!
What does it matter how we arrived? The important thing is to get…
Out.
Exactly! Number one priority, not suffocating.
Eh? Ah. Oh, thank you. Finally seeing sense. Now, what sort of state is the sub in?
Doctor.
What about the radio? Can we send a
Doctor!
What!
What is that? Gas? Could be gas.
Ah. It never rains but it pours.
We were drilling for oil in the ice. I thought I'd found a mammoth.
It's not a mammoth.
No.
What is it, then?
It's an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. And we go way back. Way back.
A Martian? You can't be serious.
I'm always serious. With days off.
Doctor.
Just keeping it light, Clara. They're scared.
They're scared? I'm scared.
No, no, no, no, no, no! Please, please. Wait, just. There is no need for this. Just hear me out. You're confused, disorientated. Of course you are. You've been lying dormant in the ice for, for, for how long? How long, Professor?
By my reckoning, five thousand years.
Five thousand years? That's a hell of a nap. Can't blame you if you've got out of the wrong side of bed. Look, nobody here wants to hurt you.
Please, just. Why don't you tell us your name?
What are you talking about? It has a name?
Of course it has a name. And a rank. This is a soldier, and it deserves our respect.
This is madness. That is a monster!
Skaldak.
What did you say?
I am Grand Marshal Skaldak.
Oh, no.
You idiot! You idiot. Grand Marshal Skaldak.
You know him.
Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. Vanquisher of the Phobos Heresy. The greatest hero the proud Martian race has ever produced.
So what do we do now?
Lock him up.
Is it true?
Er, true?
I slept for five thousand years?
Er, that's what the professor says.
Five thousand years.
The Ice Warriors have a different creed, Clara. A different code. By his own standards, Skaldak is a hero. It was said his enemies honoured him so much, they'd carve his name into their own flesh before they died.
Oh, yeah. Very nice. He sounds lovely.
An Ice Warrior? Explain.
There isn't time.
Try me.
Martian reptile know as the Ice Warrior. When Mars turned cold they had to adapt. They're bio-mechaniod. Cyborgs. Built themselves survival armour so they could exist in the freezing cold of their home world, but a sudden increase in temperature and the armour goes haywire.
Like with the cattle prod thing.
Like with the cattle prod thing. Bit of a design flaw. To be honest, I've always wondered why they never sorted it. Oh look, you've got me telling you about them and I said there wasn't time.
Is he that dangerous?
This one is.
Find me, my brothers. If you are still out there, find me.
Why are we listening to this nonsense, Captain? These people are clearly enemy agents.
Huh?
Spies, Captain.
Pretty bad spies, mate. I don't even speak Russian.
What?
I don't. Am I speaking Russian? How come I'm speaking Russian?
Now? We have to do this now?
Are they speaking Russian?
Seriously? Now? It's the TARDIS translation matrix.
In my opinion, Comrade Captain, this creature is a Western weapon.
Are they?
Yes, they're Russians.
A weapon?
Survival suit. What is the alternative? The little green man from Mars?
Correction. It's a big green man from Mars.
I don't appreciate your levity, Professor.
Why does that not surprise me? Maybe they're telling the truth.
The truth?
Yes, a revolutionary concept, I know.
It's essential that we inform Moscow of what we have found.
The radio's out of action, in case you hadn't noticed, Stepashin.
They have our last position. They will find us. When they do
Yes?
Well, the Cold War won't stay cold for ever, Captain.
For God's sake, Stepashin, you're like a stuck record. We have other priorities right now. I want you back on repairs immediately. We need to keep this ship alive. Dismissed.
Sir?
Dismissed, Stepashin.
All we needed to do was let Skaldak go and he'd have forgotten us. But you attacked him. You declared war. Harm one of us and you harm us all. That's the ancient Martian code.
You hear that? Skaldak has sent out a distress call. He will bring down the fires of hell just for laying a glove on him.
Unless you talk to it?
I'm the only one who can.
No. Out of the question. We're not losing you. I'll do it.
What?
You can talk to it through me.
Skaldak won't talk to you. You're an enemy soldier.
And how would he know that?
A soldier knows another soldier. He'll smell it on you. Smell it on you a mile off.
And he wouldn't smell it on you, Doctor?
Just let me in there before it's too late. It can't be you or any of your men.
Well, it can't be you.
Ahem. Well, there really is only one choice, isn't there. I don't smell of anything, to my knowledge.
You? No! No! No way. You're not going in there alone, Clara. Absolutely not. No, no. Never.
With your permission?
Be my guest.
Ready, Clara?
Yeah.
Okay.
Grand Marshal Skaldak.
The salute. Do the salute like I showed you.
Okay?
Good. Good. Now, like we rehearsed. Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste.
Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. By the moons, I honour the.
Good. It's okay, Clara. Go closer.
Grand Marshal, I'm, we're sorry about this.
It's not what you deserve.
It isn't what you deserve.
Oh. Oh, great.
Hey, it's okay, Clara. Keep going.
You're a long way from home.
Five thousand years.
And five thousand years adrift in time. Please, let us help you. You are not our enemy.
And yet I am in chains.
Doctor, what do I say?
Yes, Doctor. What should she say?
I think he wants to speak to the organ grinder, not to the monkey.
I heard that.
You are restrained until we can trust each other, Skaldak. You would do exactly the same in my position, and don't even think about using that sonic weapon. Not in the torpedo room.
I was Fleet Commander of the Nix Tharsis. My daughter stood by me. It was her first taste of action. We sang the songs of the Old Times. The Songs of the Red Snow.
Five thousand years. Now my daughter will be dust. Only dust.
No, no, no. Listen, your people live on Skaldak. Scattered all across the universe. And Mars will rise again, I promise you. Just let me help you.
I require no help. There will be no help.
Careful, Clara.
I'm okay.
No, listen, Clara, don't get too close.
I'm okay. Doctor, something's wrong.
What?
Something's… It's not there. It's gone!
Gone? Gone? Gone? What do you mean, gone?
It's got out.
It is time I learned the measure of my enemies, and what this vessel is capable of.
No, no, no. Skaldak!
Harm one of us and you harm us all. By the Moons, this I swear.
Clara, get out of there. Get out!
Now, I've never seen one do this before. Actually, I've never seen one out of its armour before.
Won't it be more vulnerable out of its shell?
No, it will be more dangerous.
Clara? Clara?
Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara!
I'm okay. Ha, ha! I'm okay. I'm okay! Where did he go?
How did I do? Was I okay?
This wasn't a test, Clara.
I know, but
You were great, yeah.
Really?
Really.
Doctor? The signal. It's stopped.
Skaldak got no answer from his Martian brothers. Now he's given up hope.
Hope of what?
Being rescued. He thinks he's been abandoned. He's got nothing left to lose.
But what can he do, stuck down here like the rest of us? How bad can it be?
This sub's stuffed with nuclear missiles, Zhukov. It's fat with them. What do you think Skaldak's going to do when he finds that out? How bad can it be? How bad can it be? It couldn't be any worse.
Okay. Spoke to soon.
Hello? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there!
What do you want with me?
Much.
Comrades, you know our situation. The reactor is drowned. We are totally reliant on battery power and our air is running out. Rescue is unlikely, but we still have a mission to fulfil.
If the Doctor is right, then we are all that stands between this creature and the destruction of the world.
Control of one missile is all he needs. We are expendable, comrades. Our world is not. I know I can rely on every one of you to do his duty without fail. That is all.
Listen to me. We both understand each other. This, this mewling time of peace, it doesn't suit us. We are both warriors, and together we can form an alliance.
An alliance?
Yes. To win the Cold War.
Cold War?
Both sides are capable of completely obliterating the other. It's a state we call mutually assured destruction.
Mutually assured destruction. But this has not occured.
No.
Not yet.
Even if a missile did get launched, that wouldn't be it, would it?
It?
End of the world. Game over. I mean, what if they fired one by accident. What would happen then?
I told you, Clara. Earth is like a storm waiting to break, right now. Both sides baring their teeth, talking up war. It would only take one tiny spark.
Yeah, but the world didn't end in 1983, did it, or I wouldn't be here.
New. History's in flux. It can be changed. Re-written.
How many of us are left?
Twelve. And we can't find Stepashin.
We split up and comb this sub. One team stays here to guard the bridge.
That's it? That's the plan?
Well, it's either that or we stay here and wait for him to kill us.
Okay.
Is it true you've never seen one outside of its shell suit?
Shell suit? Clara! For an Ice Warrior to leave its armour is the gravest dishonour. Skaldak is desperate. He is deadly and we have got to find him.
Will this help?
Ah! You saved it.
No, no, it was on the floor with this.
[THE DOCTOR KISSES A BARBIE DOLL.]
Ah, Professor, I could kiss you.
If you insist.
Later.
Do you think it's true, sir? A Martian?
I don't know what to think.
So, why have you got a cattle prod on a submarine?
Polar bears.
Ah, right.
We run across them when we're drilling. Can be quite nasty, you know.
I'd swap one for an Ice Warrior any day. Cuddlier.
Courage, my dear. I always sing a song.
What?
To keep my spirits up.
Yeah, that would work, if this was Pinocchio.
Do you know Hungry Like The Wolf?
What?
Duran Duran. One of my favourites. Come on.
I'm not singing a song.
What was that?
Pressure. Just pressure. We're seven hundred metres down, remember?
Don't worry about it. Think of something else.
I am hungry like the wolf.
I'm not singing.
Don't you know it?
Course I know it. We do it at karaoke, the odd hen night.
Karaoke? Hen night? You speak excellent Russian, my dear, but sometimes I don't understand a word you're talking about.
If we get out of here, we'll be bloody heroes.
If we get out of here.
The first people in the world to discover a genuine, living
Alien? I don't know. You hear stories, don't you. Stories about the things the Kremlin doesn't want us to… Onegin? Onegin!
Good God. Torn apart. It's a monster, a savage.
No, Professor. Not savage. Forensic. Well, he's dismantled them. Skaldak's learning. Learning all about you. Your strengths, your weaknesses. Come on.
Stay here.
Okay.
Stay here. Don't argue.
I'm not.
Right. Good.
Oh, it's a young man's game, all this dashing about. Clara, what is it?
I was doing okay. I mean, I went in there and I did the scary stuff, didn't I? I went in there with the Ice Warrior and it went okay. Actually, it went just about as badly as it could have done but that wasn't my fault.
Not at all.
So I'm happy about that.
Yes.
Chuffed.
And so you should be. So what's the matter?
Seeing those bodies back there. It's all got very real. Are we going to make it?
Yes, of course.
It's in the walls.
Oh, Stepashin.
Oh, oh, oh. Fast. He's fast.
What was that?
The Doctor told you, it's just the boat settling. Tell me about yourself. What do you like doing? Clara? Clara?
Stuff. You know, stuff.
Stuff. Very enlightening. And the Doctor, what he said. Is it true you're from another time? From our future? Clara?
Yes.
Tell me what happens.
I can't.
Well, I need to know.
I'm not allowed.
No, please.
I can't!
Ultravox, do they split up?
Funny. You're funny.
Let her go!
See? I don't just like Western music.
No, please don't hurt him. Please!
You attacked me. Martian law decrees that the people of this planet are forfeit. I now have all the information I require. It will take only one missile to begin the process. To end this Cold War.
Grand Marshal, there is no need for this. Listen to me.
My distress call has not been answered. It will never be answered. My people are dead. They are dust. There is nothing left for me except my revenge.
There is something left for you, Skaldak. Mercy.
Mercy?
You must wear that armour for a reason, my friend. Let's see, shall we?
No, Captain, wait!
I will do whatever it takes to defend my world, Doctor.
Yes, great, fine, good, but we are getting somewhere here. We are negotiating. Jaw-jaw not war-war.
Churchill?
Churchill.
Very well, we'll negotiate, but from a position of strength.
Excellent tactical thinking. My congratulations, Captain.
Thank you.
Unfortunately, your position is not, perhaps, as strong as you might hope.
What do you mean?
He summoned the armour.
How did it do that?
Sonic tech, Clara. The song of the Ice Warrior.
No!
My world is dead but now there will be a second red planet. Red with the blood of humanity!
Skaldak! Skaldak, wait! No! Skaldak, wait! Wait, wait.
He's arming the warheads.
Where is the honour in condemning billions of innocents to death?
Five thousand years ago Mars was the centre of a vast empire. The jewel of this solar system. The people of Earth had only just begun to leave their caves.
Five thousand years isn't such a long time. They're still just frightened children, still primitive. Who are you to judge them?
I am Skaldak! This planet is forfeit under Martian law.
Then teach them. Teach them, Grand Marshal. Show them another way. Show them there is honour in mercy. Is this how you want history to remember you? Grand Marshal Skaldak, Destroyer of Earth. Because that's what you'll be if you send those missiles. Not a soldier, a murderer.
Five billion lives extinguished. No chance for goodbyes. A world snuffed out like a candle flame! All right. All right, Skaldak, you leave me no choice. I'm a Time Lord, Skaldak. I know a thing or two about sonic technology myself.
A threat? You threaten me, Doctor?
No. No, not you, all of us. I will blow this sub up before you can even reach that button, Grand Marshal. Blow us all to oblivion.
You would sacrifice yourself?
In a heartbeat.
Mutually assured destruction.
Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Look into my eyes and tell me you're capable of doing this. Huh? Can you do that? Dare you do that? Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Come on. Face to face.
Well, Doctor.
Which of us shall blink first?
Why did you hesitate? Back there, in the dark. You were going to kill this man, remember? I begged you not to, and you listened. Why show compassion then, Skaldak, and not now?
The Doctor's right. Billions will die. Mothers, sons, fathers, daughters. Remember that last battle, Skaldak? Your daughter. You sang the songs.
Of the Red Snows.
What's happening?
My people live. They have come for me!
We're rising. We're rising!
Six hundred metres. Five fifty.
We've surfaced. Your people have saved us.
Saved me, not you.
Just go, Skaldak, please. Please, go in peace.
We did it. We did it!
No. No, no, no, no, no. It's still armed. A single pulse from that ship. I'll destroy us if I have to. I will destroy us if I have to. Show mercy, Skaldak. Come on. Show mercy.
I'm lost and I'm found, and I'm hungry like the wolf.
Now we're safe.
Ahem. Saved the world, then?
Yeah.
That's what we do.
Yeah
The TARDIS! Where's the TARDIS? You never explained.
Oh well, don't worry about that.
Stop saying that. Where is it?
Yeah. Well, I wasn't to know, was I?
Know what?
I've been tinkering, breaking her in. I'm allowed.
What did you do?
I reset the HADS.
Huh?
I reset the HADS
The what?
The HADS. The Hostile Action Displacement System. If the TARDIS comes under attack, gunfire, time winds, the sea, it relocates.
Oh, Doctor.
Haven't used it in donkey's years. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Well, never mind, it's bound to turn up somewhere.
Ooo. Ha, see? Right on cue. Brilliant.
Brilliant.
The TARDIS is at the pole.
Not far, then.
The south pole.
Ah.
Could we have a lift?

How are we looking?
Oh, about ready, I think.
Any thoughts on the interference?
Er, a stray FM broadcast, possibly. I've fitted some ferrite suppressors and some RF chokes, just in case. Are you sure you want to go through with this? I mean, the last time, it was very
But she's so lonely.
Excellent, then. Excellent.
Caliburn House, night four, November 25th, 1974. 11.04 pm.
I'm talking to the spirit that inhabits this house. Are you there? Can you hear me? I'm speaking to the lost soul that abides in this place.
Come to me. Speak to me. Let me show you the way home.
Let me show you the way home!
Emma?
She's so…
So what?
Dead.
Boo! Hello, I'm looking for a ghost.
And you are?
Ghostbusters.
I'm the Doctor.
Doctor what?
If you like. And this is Clara.
Ah, but you are very different. You are Major Alec Palmer. Member of the Baker Street Irregulars, the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Specialised in espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance behind enemy lines. 
You're a talented watercolourist, professor of psychology and ghost hunter. Total pleasure. Massive.
Actually, you're wrong. Professor Palmer spent most of the war as a POW.
Actually, that's a like told by a very brave man involved in very secret operations. The type of man who keeps a Victoria Cross in a box in the attic, eh? But you know that, because you're Emma Grayling, the Professor's companion.
Assistant.
It's 1974. You're the assistant and non-objective equipment. Meaning psychic.
Getting that. Bless you, though.
Relax, Emma. He's Military Intelligence. So, what is all this in aid of?
Health and safety. Yeah, the Ministry got wind of what's going on down here. Sent me to check that everything's in order.
They don't have the right.
Don't worry, guv'nor, I'll be out of your hair in five minutes. Oh! Oh, look. Oh, lovely. The ACR 99821. Oh, bliss. Nice action on the toggle switches. 
You know, I do love a toggle switch. Actually, I like the word toggle. Nice noun. Excellent verb. Oi, don't mess with the settings.
What's that?
Gadget. Health and safety. Classified, I'm afraid. You know, while the back-room boffins work out a few kinks.
What's it telling you?
It's telling me that you haven't been exposed to any life-threatening transmundane emanations. So, where's the ghost? Show me the ghost. It's ghost time.
I will not have this stolen out from under me, do you understand.
Er, no, not really, sorry.
I will not have my work stolen, then be fobbed off with a pat on the back and a letter from the Queen. Never again. This is my house, Doctor, and it belongs to me.
This is actually your house?
It is.
Sorry. You went to the bank and said, you know that gigantic old haunted house on the moors? The one the dossers are too scared to doss in? The one the birds are too scared to fly over? And then you said, I'd like to buy it, please, with my money.
Yes, I did, actually.
That's incredibly brave.
Listen, Major, we just need to know what's going on here.
For the Ministry.
You know I can't answer that.
Very well, follow me.
So, what's an empathic psychic?
Sometimes I sense feelings, the way a telepath can sense thoughts. Sometimes, though. Not always.
The most compassionate people you'll ever meet, empathics. And the loneliest. I mean, exposing themselves to all those hidden feelings, all that guilt, pain and sorrow and
Doctor?
Yes?
Shush.
Would you care to have a look?
Caliburn House is over four hundred years old, but she has been here much longer. The Caliburn Ghast.
She's mentioned in local Saxon poetry and parish folk tales. The Wraith of the Lady, the Maiden in the Dark, the Witch of the Well.
Is she real? As in, actually real?
Oh, she's real. In the 17th century, a local clergyman saw her. He wrote that her presence was accompanied by a dreadful knocking, as if the Devil himself demanded entry.
During the war, American airmen stationed here left offerings of tinned Spam. The tins were found in 1965, bricked up in the servants' pantry, along with a number of handwritten notes. Appeals to the Ghast.
For the love of God, stop screaming.
She never changes. The angle's different, the framing, but she's always in exactly the same position. Why is that?
We don't know. She's an objective phenomenon, but objective recording equipment can't detect her.
Without the presence of a powerful psychic.
Absolutely. Very well done.
She knows I'm here. I can feel her calling out to me.
What's she saying?
Help me.
The Witch of the Well. So, where's the well?
A copy of the oldest plan that we could find. There is no well on the property. None that we could find, anyway.
You coming?
Where?
To find the ghost.
Why would I want to do that?
Because you want to. Come on.
Well, I dispute that assertion.
Eh? I'm giving you a face. Can you see me? Look at my face.
Fine. Dare me.
I dare you. No takesies backsies.
The music room is the heart of the house.
Say we actually find her. What do we say?
We ask her how she came to be whatever she is.
Why?
Because I don't know, and ignorance is, what's the opposite of bliss?
Carlisle.
Yes. Yes, Carlisle. Ignorance is Carlisle.
Is he really from the Ministry?
Er, I don't know. He's certainly got the right demeanour. Capricious, brilliant.
Deceitful.
Yes. Ha. He's a liar. But, you know, that's often the way that it is when someone's seen a thing or two. Experience makes liars of us all. We lie about who we are, about what we've done.
And how we feel?
Yes. Always. Always that. You know, I have to, have to be getting on with things. The er, the equipment and so forth.
Of course.
Ah, the music room. The heart of the house. Do you feel anything?
No.
Your pants are so on fire.
Do you feel like you're being watched?
What does being watched feel like? Is it that funny tickly feeling on the back of your neck?
That's the chap.
Then yes, a bit. Well, quite a big bit.
I think she's here.
Cold spot. Spooky. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold.
Doctor? Doctor!
What?
I'm not happy.
No
Hey!
What was that?
Does it seem colder?
She's coming.
Okay, what is that?
It's a very loud noise. It's a very loud, very angry noise.
What's making it?
I don't know. Are you making it?
Doctor?
Yes?
I may be a teeny, tiny bit terrified.
But I'm still a grown-up.
Mainly, yes, and?
There's no need to actually hold my hand.
Clara.
Yeah?
I'm not holding your hand.
[THE DOCTOR AND CLARA SCREAM.]
Has this happened before?
Never.
Camera. Camera!
Doctor?
Help me!
Doctor.
Urgh. I'd rather have a nice cup of tea.
Me too. Whisky is the eleventh most disgusting thing ever invented.
I had a little peek at your records, back at the Ministry. You've certainly seen a thing or two in your time. Disrupting U-boat operations across the North Sea, sabotaging railway lines across Europe. 
Operation Gibbon. The one with the carrier pigeons, brilliant. I do love a carrier pigeon.
I did my duty, but then so did thousands of others. Millions of others. I was just lucky enough to come back.
Yes, but how does that man, that war hero, end up here in a lonely old house, looking for ghosts?
Because I killed, and I caused to have killed. I sent young men and women to their deaths, but here I am, still alive and it does tend to haunt you. Living, after so much of the other thing.
So, you and Professor Palmer, have you ever, you know?
No.
Why not? You do know how he feels about you, don't you? You, of all people?
I don't know. People like me, sometimes we get our signals mixed up. We think people are feeling the way we want them to feel, you know, when they are special to us, when really there's nothing there.
Oh, this is there.
How do you know?
Because it's obvious. It sticks out like a big chin.
You see, I was alone and unmarried and I didn't mind dying. I mean, not for that cause. It was a very, very fine cause, defeating the enemy.
And if you could contact them, what would you say?
Well, I'd very much like to thank them.
Ah ha. Ping!
Who do you think she is?
Not what I thought she'd be.
What did you think she's be?
Fun. Can I borrow your camera? Ta.
What about you and the Doctor?
Oh, I don't think so.
Good.
Sorry?
Don't trust him. There's a sliver of ice in his heart.
Clara!
I've got this weird feeling it's looking at me. It doesn't like me.
The TARDIS is like a cat. A bit slow to trust, but you'll get there in the end.
Hey. You need a place to keep this.
I've got one. Or I had one. I think I had one. Look around. See if you find it. Did I have one? Am I going mad?
No, not in here. How do you expect her to like you? She's soaking wet. It's a health and safety nightmare.
Sorry. So, where are we going?
Nowhere. We're staying right here. Right here, on this exact spot, if I can work out how to do it.
So, when are we going?
Oh, that is good. That is top-notch.
And the answer is?
We're going always.
We're going always.
Totally.
That's not actually a sentence.
Well, it's got a verb in it. What do you think?
Colour's a bit boisterous.
I think it brings out my eyes.
Makes my eyes hurt.
Did you see where he went? I could hear an engine but I can't see any lights.
Back off. Hot suit. Hot, hot, hot.
When are we?
About six billion years ago. It's a Tuesday, I think.
Back in a mo. Are you all right?
Totally. Peachy keen.
Okay then. Well, don't press any buttons or pull any levers or make any funny faces. Actually, don't move. Stand completely still. Don't breathe. Well, you can breathe, but shallow breaths.
Oh. What's wrong? Did the TARDIS say something to you? Are you being mean?
No, it's not that. Have we just watched the entire life cycle of Earth, birth to death?
Yes.
And you're okay with that?
Yes
How can you be?
The TARDIS, she's time. Wibbly vortex and so on.
That's not what I mean.
Okay, some help. Context? Cheat sheet? Something?
I mean, one minute you're in 1974 looking for ghosts, but all you have to do is open your eyes and talk to whoever's standing there. To you, I haven't been born yet, and to you I've been dead one hundred billion years.
Is my body out there somewhere, in the ground?
Yes, I suppose it is.
But here we are, talking. So I am a ghost. To you, I'm a ghost. We're all ghosts to you. We must be nothing.
No. No. You're not that.
Then what are we? What can we possibly be?
You are the only mystery worth solving.
What's wrong?
I just saw something I wish I hadn't.
What did you see?
That everything ends.
No, not everything. Not love. Not always.
Right, done. That's it. Gather round, gather round. Roll up, roll up.
The Ghost of Caliburn House. Never changing, trapped in a moment of fear and torment. But, what if she's not? What if she's just trapped somewhere time runs more slowly than it does here? What if a second to her was a hundred thousand years to us?
And what if somebody has a magic box. A blue box, probably. What if said somebody could take a snapshot of her, say, every few million years?
She's not a ghost. But she's definitely a lost soul. Her name is Hila Tacorian. She's a pioneer, a time traveller, or at least she will be in a few hundred years.
Time travel's not possible. The paradoxes
Resolve themselves, by and large.
How long has she been alone?
Well, time travel's a funny old thing. I mean, from her perspective, she crash landed three minutes ago.
Crash landed? Where?
She's in a pocket universe. A distorted echo of our own. They happen sometimes but never last for long.
But what's she running from?
Well, that's the best bit. We don't know yet. Shall we see?
Oh.
What is that?
I don't know. Still, not to worry.
So, what do we do?
Not we, you. You save Hila Tacorian because you are Emma Grayling. You are the lantern. The rest of us are just along for the ride, I'm afraid. We need some sturdy rope and a blue crystal from Metebelis Three. Plus some Kendal Mint Cake.
Don't do it.
I'm sorry?
Nobody asked her to risk her life. This woman, she doesn't deserve. Whoever she is, however brilliant, however brave, she's not you. She is not worth risking a single hair on your head. Not to me.
Tell me what I'm thinking.
I can't. I don't have your gift.
You don't need it. Just look at me and tell me.
There you are, you read my mind.
Can't you just, you know?
What?
Fly the TARDIS into the parallel universe?
Ah, it's not a parallel universe. It's a pocket universe. Plus, it is collapsing. I mean, the TARDIS could get in there all right, but entropy would bleed her power sources, you see? Trap her there until the entire universe decayed back into the quantum foam.
Which would take about three minutes, give or take, you know.
What is that?
A subset of the Eye of Harmony.
I don't –
Of course you don't. Be weird if you did. I barely do myself. Right. You, sit down. All the way from Metebelis Three.
What does it do?
It amplifies your natural abilities like a microphone, or a pooper scooper.
What exactly is this arrangement?
A psychochronograph.
Forgive me, but isn't it all a bit well, make do and mend?
Non-psychic technology won't work where I'm going. Listen, all I need to do is dive into another dimension, find the time traveller, help her escape the monster. get home before the entire dimension collapses and Bob's your uncle.
Doctor, will it hurt?
No. Well, yes. Probably. A bit. Well, quite a lot. I don't know. It might be agony. To be perfectly honest, I'll be interested to find out.
I'm talking to the lost soul that abides in this place. I'm speaking to Hila Tarcorian.
See? The Witch of the Well! It's a wormhole! A reality well! A door to the echo universe. Ready?
Ready!
Geronimo.
Doctor!
Hila? Hila! Hila Tacorian!
One, two, three.
Help me! Help!
Hila Tacorian, I presume.
Who are you?
Collapsing universe. You and me, dead, two minutes. No time complete sentences. Abandon planet.
Wait. There's something in the mist.
Then run. Run!
Doctor! Doctor! Come home! Doctor, come home!
Not that way, which means, er, probably.
What's wrong?
You know that exit I mentioned?
Yes?
I seem to have misplaced it.
Doctor!
This way.
Doctor! Come home!
Doctor, we're here.
Whoa.
What's that?
An echo house, in an echo universe. Clever psychic. That is just top-notch.
Doctor! Doctor!
It's looking for a way in.
I'm not strong enough!
Just a few more seconds.
Grab the rope. Give it three tugs, quick as you like.
What about you?
I'll be next.
Oh, that's what that noise was. Lovely.
No!
Oh dear.
[THE TARDIS CLOISTER BELL TOLLS.]
Oh dear. Where are you?
Wake up! Wake up! Open the thing.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. Don't be. What you did…
Wasn't enough. She needs to do it again.
She can't. Look at her.
She has to! We can't leave him.
I know that you feel you can't do this, Emma, but look at that woman over there. You saved her. She's only here because of your strength, and so am I.
Oh, come on! Let me in, you grumpy old cow!
Whoa.
I was as lost as her, but being with you, you gave me a reason to be, Emma. You brought me back from the dead.
What's this now?
The TARDIS Voice Visual Interface. I'm programmed to select the image of a person you esteem. Of several billion such images in my databanks, this one best meets the criterion.
Oh. Oh, you are a cow. I knew it. Whatever. You have to help the Doctor.
The Doctor is in the pocket universe.
You can enter the pocket universe.
The entropy would drain the energy from my heart. In four seconds, I'd be stranded. In ten, I'd be dead.
You're talking, but all I hear is muh muh muh. Come on, let's go.
Hey, hey, hey!
Doctor.
Can you hear me? Doctor!
Oh, come on.
Doctor, can you hear me?
Ah! Whoa!
Doctor!
Doctor, we're here. Come home.
Emma?
What do you want? To frighten me, I suppose, eh? Because that's what you do. You hide. You're the bogeyman under the bed, seeking whom you may devour.
You want me to be afraid. Then well done. I am the Doctor, and I am afraid.
Doctor, hurry!
So why am I still here, huh? Why not just eat me? Ha? Come on. Because you still need me.
Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across. To which I say, come on then, big boy, chase me.
You wanted a word?
Well, if that's…
That's fine. You didn't come here for the ghost, did you?
No.
You came here for me.
Yes.
Why?
I needed to ask you something.
Then ask.
Clara.
Yes?
What is she?
She's a girl.
Yes, but what kind of girl, specifically?
She's a perfectly ordinary girl. Very pretty, very clever, more scared than she lets on.
And that's it, is it?
Why? Is that not enough?
Where will you go?
He can't take me home. History says I went missing.
But he can change history.
No, no, no, I can't, actually. There are fixed points in time, you see.
Hi.
What?
I knew you were there. I could feel you.
I know.
Have we -?
We can't have. You haven't even been born yet.
No, you can't have met, but she can be your great, great, great, great, great granddaughter. Yours too, of course. But you guessed that already, didn't you. Oh. Apparently not.
The paradoxes…
Resolve themselves, by and large. That's why the psychic link was so powerful. Blood calling to blood, out of time. Not everything ends. Not love. Not always.
Doctor, what about, what about us? Emma and me?
What about you?
Well, what's supposed to happen? I mean, what do we do now?
Hold hands. That's what you're meant to do. Keep doing that and don't let go. That's the secret.
Doctor! I'm not happy.
Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across.
I'm not holding your hand.
Oh, I'm so slow! I am slow. I'm notorious for it. That's always been my problem. But, but I get there in the end. Oh yes.
Doctor?
How do sharks make babies?
Carefully?
No, no, no. Happily!
Sharks don't actually smile. They're just, well, they've got lots and lots of teeth. They're quite eaty.
Exactly. But birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it. Every lonely monster needs a companion.
There's two of them?
It's the oldest story in the universe, this one or any other. Boy and girl fall in love, get separated by events. War, politics, accidents in time. She's thrown out of the hex, or he's thrown into it. 
Since then they've been yearning for each other across time and space, across dimensions.
This isn't a ghost story, it's a love story!
Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt the rest of your life. So. Tiny favour to ask.
I'm sorry! I understand now! I can take you to her! I can take you to a safe place far away from here! You can be together! Well, come on, then. She's waiting!
Well, hello again, you old Romeo, you. Now, here she comes.
Get ready to jump.

Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate.
Rusty garbage. It's not worth lacing up my boots.
Wasting our time. There's no salvage this far out.
You're a lucky boy, Tricky. You're an android. You don't get bored.
He won't turn back. Not with half a cargo.
He's not captain. We're equal partners.
Yeah. Right.
You said…
I know what I said. I was the one who said it.
You said it was looking at you funny.
I was tired, overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance. It does a job.
It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese grater here.
You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properly bonkers.
It's okay, it's okay.
You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his mother approves.
It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alone together.
Now you're creeping me out.
Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it down to basic mode for you.
Basic? Because I'm a girl?
No.
Everyone suit up. It's good salvage. I can smell it.
It's just trash.
No, look. There's something tasty in the magno-field.
Magno-grab ready. Engaging.
Move yourself.
What have I done?
Er, okay.
Doctor?
All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shields back up. She's completely vulnerable.
I swear I just touched it.
Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.
Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.
Oh, yes. Big friendly button.
You're lying.
Yep.
To stop me freaking out?
Is it working?
Not so much.
What is it, some kind of escape pod?
Come on.
Crack it open.
It's doing nothing.
Use the thermo-charge and blast it.
No, no, no, wait. It's like she's alive. She's, she's suffering. I can feel it. I can feel it.
That's just robot rant.
No, Gregor, he's right. Looks like there's a broken fuel line.
All right. All right, put it back. No salvage today, boys. Open the bay doors.
Wait.
Somebody's under that thing. The crew were still on board when we dragged her in.
We did nothing. If anyone asks, that ship was already busted. You got that? And you, make sure you keep your oily mouth shut, right?
It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, Van Baalen and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to get confusing later.
We found you drifting.
Yeah, your ship was junked up pretty bad.
What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in your pocket. Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, this little beastie can disable whole vessels unless you have shield oscillators, which I turned off so that Clara could fly, damn it.
Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high. Feisty. She's still on board.
No, wait. Your pod is leaking fuel. If she's still in here, she's dead.
Ah, respirators.
We can open the doors for a split second, reach in and grab her.
Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out.
I'm telling you, she fried
Shut it, tin mouth. What sort of fee are we talking?
If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap, eh?
It's not worth the risk. Four feet of metal? Nah.
What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had?
Bram, open the bay doors.
No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doors is the salvage of a lifetime.
Doctor? Doctor?
Red flashing light means something bad. Get out of here fast? Or possibly, whatever you do, don't open this door.
Bad decision.
Hey, are we really going to risk it? That thing is spewing poison. We should blow it back into space.
Get your gear.
Hey, I don't take orders from my kid brother.
Don't try and form sentences, all right? Stick to what you do best.
Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and a respirator?
Flesh coating, same as us. He'd burn up.
No fear, no hate, no pain.
Salvage of a lifetime?
I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go.
I don't get it. I thought she was lying on her side.
The TARDIS is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain if I had some charts and a board pen.
It's, it's, it's bigger
On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot.
Whoa. Awesome.
Well put. Whoa and awesome.
Safe to breathe.
Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there. Come on, Clara, talk to me.
How big is this baby?
Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturing it?
Yeah.
Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite.
It could take you hours to find the girl.
Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by the time I reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her in one hour.
We?
You're my guys for this.
That wasn't the deal.
Tis now.
What makes you think we'll help?
I just activated the TARDIS self-destruct system. One hour until this ship blows.
Don't try to leave. The TARDIS is in lockdown. I'll open those doors when Clara's by my side.
You crazy lunatic!
My ship, my rules.
You'll kill us all. And the girl.
She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a spaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a little gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes.
She'll die even quicker now!
We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go for fifteen minutes?
Whoa!
It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. You meant the ship. I meant Clara.
Oh!
Report. What's on board this thing?
Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beam synthesiser, orthogonal engine filters.
Guys, guys, look, I think we should split up. It's our best chance of finding the girl. You know it is.
Don't touch a thing. The TARDIS will get huffy if you mess.
Keep in radio contact, all right?
Get back to the console. Strip it apart.
Okay.
All right?
Now that's just showing off.
I made up the name TARDIS from the initials Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
The TARDIS is dimensionally transcendental.
What does that mean?
That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lord discovery.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door. Believe me, they've tried.
We are in space!
It can move anywhere in time and space?
Everything.
What? Report.
Everything, behind that door.
Everything?
Sensor detects everything you could possibly want.
Everything
I don't understand. Give me a price tag.
Incalculable.
What?
More valuable than the total sum of any currency. Living metal. Bespoke engineering. Whatever machine you require, this system will build it.
No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. She won't let you touch it. I can feel a TARDIS tantrum coming on.
What the hell is this place?
Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particles according to your needs.
A machine that makes machines?
Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't!
If you walk out of here with that circuit, the TARDIS will try to stop you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must find Clara.
What the -? Where's the door gone?
Ever seen a spaceship get ugly?
This isn't happening.
She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material.
Torch it. I said, torch it.
Can't you feel it, Gregor? The ship, the ship's in torment, like it's a living thing. You can't hurt it.
What's the matter, TARDIS? Scared to fight me?
So that's who…
It's the same. It's just the same.
It's diverting us, spinning a maze around us. We will never reach Clara in time.
Hey! Hey!
It's just the same, again.
No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash them down. It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, Time Lords. No dress sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get out of here, let that circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth.
Bram? Bram, can you hear me? Bram, the ship is alive. Get out of there. Bram, don't touch anything.
You're just the sweetest thing ever.
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
No! The door. Where's the door gone? No. You can't do this.
Bram? You've got to get out of there fast.
Channel's dead.
We've got to help him. Gregor, do something. Do something!
It's too late, he's gone. Let's just worry about the salvage.
You care more about that circuit than you do about him.
Your concern for your brother is really touching. The android is more cut up about it than you. Now will you two stop bickering and listen. There is something else down there.
We've got to get out of here. Gregor, give it back. Give it back to her.
What are you doing? You're always on the side of the machines.
Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the TARDIS with us. I am getting a massive signal.
Where are they?
Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away. One step.
Gregor, look out! Careful! Gregor, no! We have to stay together. Come on, run. Tricky, run. I'm sorry.
Oh, why are you doing this?
Back where we started.
No, it's an echo. The console room is the safest place on the ship. It can replicate itself any number of times. It's trying to protect us.
Because I tried to give back the circuit?
Team TARDIS.
Where did, where did that go?
There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The TARDIS has got Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Why can't we see her?
It's like a light switch. Two positions, flickering at super-infinite speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush.
I can hear her.
She's let it in. She's let it in!
If I can just isolate her position, I can nudge the alternation, reach in and grab her.
Who are you?
Console room, echo imprint of the original.
You're coming with me. I need you to get me out of here.
Scanning for female human. Scanning for female human. Unidentified human.
It doesn't know Lancashire.
What?
It doesn't know sass. Yes! It's found Clara. It's found her. She is right there.
It's all right. Clara, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry. Please, please forgive me, Clara.
[CLARA HITS THE DOCTOR.]
Ow! Okay, so we're not doing hugging. I get that now.
What do you keep in here? Why have you got zombie creatures? Good guys do not have zombie creatures. Rule one basic storytelling.
Not in front of the guests.
Who are they?
Friends. Well, people who aren't trying to kill us, so I don't need punching again.
All right, all right. Look, a deal's a deal. You got the girl back. Now cancel the self-destruct.
Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing you in my quiz team.
What?
There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though, boys, didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wiggly button trick. And the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or we all die. I thought I rushed it a bit, but
So you're telling us we're safe?
Ish. Apart from the monsters and the TARDIS reinventing the architecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's a fake. Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made it look as though the engine was actually exploding.
Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic.
Something you want to share with the rest of us?
It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara. Proper trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast.
So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button, right?
Yes. Sorry, I should have had one built in.
Where are we going?
Detour.
The centre of the TARDIS.
Shush. Something's in here.
Those things, they've followed us.
Doctor, what are they? What aren't you telling me?
Trust me. Some things you don't want to know.
They're on the move again.
Run. Move, move.
Doctor? Doctor? Again.
I know what I said. I was the one who said it.
You said it was looking at you funny.
Now you're creeping me out. Please tell me there is a button you can press to fix this?
Oh, thank god. Doctor, what's going on? Say something.
Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in time somewhere on board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of the continuum. It must have happened when the TARDIS was pulled in by the salvage vessel. The TARDIS is leaking.
Leaking what?
The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we've said. Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory.
What about this?
If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real.
She's right on to us.
She?
Clara, don't ask me any more.
You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his mother approves.
It's important to me you get along.
What's that noise?
We're right under the primary fuel cells.
So? So, so what?
So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed. Means they'll cool
And start to warp.
And start to warp. Maybe even
No, you don't say it. Don't you dare say it.
Maybe even break apart.
Run?
I'm liking how you're thinking.
Yeah.
Cut it off. Just cut my arm off.
No.
It's the quickest way to release me. No fear, no hate, no pain. I can get a new one. Disposable parts. Just do it. It won't hurt me.
Tricky, you just don't understand.
I'm an android. Cut me!
You made it through.
What's the matter with you? Why won't you cut me?
Tell him.
Tell me what?
You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but you're scared to tell him why.
What's he going on about?
Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators. They don't get frightened of monsters in the dark.
What's he talking about?
Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend, are human. Flesh and blood.
It was a joke.
What?
It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom.
Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed your identity just to provide some in-flight entertainment.
I'm sorry. You're human, Tricky.
Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go!
Where are we?
Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe. We can only survive for a minute or two in there.
Er, what happens if we stay longer?
Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn.
I always feel so good after we've spoken.
Marvellous. Keep this door shut.
That will not be a problem.
Lancashire. Sass.
Intelligent sensor.
Ever pointed that thing at yourself, Gregor? What would it see? What sort of person does this to another human? Made them believe they're made of metal. Who am I?
My mouthy little kid brother.
Why, why can't I remember?
It was a salvage accident. There was a big explosion. You lost your sight, voice and your memory.
And you, you thought of a way you could have some fun with me? I just wanted a brother beside me!
You were always the smart one, Tricky. He wanted you to take over. He made you captain.
He?
Dad.
I don't remember him. You did this to me just to be captain of a heap of junk.
Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cut you up. He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and you helped him find that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this.
Okay, move, move, move.
The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming a black hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit, suspend it in a permanent state of decay. This way, quickly.
There's no way out. We're trapped.
You're going to tell me right now. If we're going to die here, you're going to tell me what they are.
I can't.
Tell me. What's the use in secrets now?
Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe.
We're not safe!
Sensor detects animal DNA. Human core element. Calculating data. Calculating data.
No, no, turn it off!
Lancashire. Sass. Identifiable substance. Clara.
That's me.
I'm so sorry.
It's me. I burn in here.
It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It's the future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but it happened again. You died again.
What do you mean, again?
Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can't happen. Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassert itself.
Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit.
Just let it go.
Gregor, Gregor.
Okay. Er, er…
Tricky!
Doctor?
No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself.
The engine room. The heart of the TARDIS.
We're outside.
No, we're still in the TARDIS.
There's no way across.
No, okay, you're right.
So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan?
Well, no. No plan. Sorry.
If you don't have a plan, we're dead.
Yes, we are. So just tell me.
Tell you what?
Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell me who you are.
You know who I am.
No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don't understand a thing about you. Why do I keep running into you?
Doctor, you invited me. You said…
Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you.
She really wasn't.
Victorian London. There was a governess who was really a barmaid, and we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and it was my fault, and she was you.
You're scaring me.
What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap?
I don't know what you're talking about!
You really don't, do you.
I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else on that TARDIS.
You're just Clara, aren't you.
Okay, I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug is really nice.
We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl.
What?
What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away. We're close to the engine. The TARDIS is snarling at us, trying to frighten us off. We need to jump.
You're insane.
We'll cross a portal to the engine.
How can you be so sure?
I can't.
Okay, well, that's watertight.
Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundred years. Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all the other times. Ready? Geronimo.
The heart of the TARDIS. The engine, it's already exploded. It must have been the collision with the salvage ship.
We're not dead.
She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it.
So, so it's safe?
Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There's no way I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, and taken care of me, and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. I think it just
Oh, Clara. Oh.
You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Like parchment. Thank you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. I need to find the moment we crashed. I need to find the music.
The time rift. Recent past, possible future.
What are you going to do?
Rewrite today, I hope.
I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure this time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certain amount of yelling.
It's going to hurt?
Things that end your life often do that.
Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before, how I died.
Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mend anything.
I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it. You were mentioned in a book.
I'm mentioned in a lot of books.
You call yourself Doctor. Why do you do that? You have a name. I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny…
If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go looking for my name.
You'll still have secrets.
It's better that way.
Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.
Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.
Oh, yes. Big friendly button.
You're lying.
Yep.
To stop me freaking out?
Is it working?
Not so much.
Doctor, Doctor. I'm from your future. We haven't got long to reset time.
Clara, no! No!
Ah ha! Big friendly button.
I don't get it. It was on screen, then it was gone.
Hey, robot, go get me some food. I'm starving.
Oi, leave him alone.
What's the matter with you?
Maybe I've just got a little tiny scrap of decency.
I feel exhausted. I feel…
We've had two days crammed into the space of one.
Why would you say that?
I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe?
Of course.
Give me a number out of ten. Ten being whoo hoo, one being argh.
You're being weird.
I need to know if you feel safe. I need to know you're not afraid.
Of?
The future. Running away with a spaceman in a box. Anything could happen to you.
That's what I'm counting on. Push the button.
"""THE CRIMSON HORROR
4 May 2013 — 07x11
—written by Mark Gatiss"
If I have not returned in an hour, you must fetch the police.
Edmund!
Don't fret, Effie, my dear. All will be well, but we must get to the bottom of this dark and queer business no matter what the cost.
Mrs Gillyflower!
We have come about your husband, my dear. A tragedy.
My husband?
Your late husband.
There must be some mistake. My husband is quite well.
We're so very sorry for your loss.
Hell fire. That's put me right off me mash. Another one.
Another?
He's not the first one I've had in here looking like that. The Crimson Horror, that's what they're calling it.
I have no interest in the deplorable excesses of the Penny Dreadfuls.
Hey, hey. Payment in advance, flower. Taking a big risk, you see, I am. They'll have my vitals for fiddle-strings if they knew I'd let you come to look at one of their precious stiffs.
This stiff is my brother. I've come up from London to bring him home.
Oh aye?
Thank you for agreeing to this meeting. I'm told you are the investigator to see if there are strange goings-on.
I read of your brother's death. Another victim of the Crimson Horror, I believe.
So it is claimed. He was a newspaper man. He and a young woman were working undercover. Tell me, madam, do you know what an optogram is?
It is a silly superstition, sir. The belief that the eye can retain an image of the last thing it sees.
Good grief.
Oh, God.
Well, I'll be blowed. I think, madam, that we'd better make plans to head north.
According to my research, Sweetville's proprietor holds recruitment drives for her little community. She is only interested in the fittest and the most beautiful.
You may rely on me, ma'am.
I was, in fact, speaking to Jenny.
Jenny. If this weak and fleshy boy is to represent us, I strongly recommend the issuing of scissor grenades, limbo vapour and triple blast brain splitters.
What for?
Just generally. Remember, we are going to the north.
Bradford, that Babylon of the moderns with its crystal light and its glitter, all aswarm with the wretched ruins of humanity. Men and women crushed by the devil's juggernaut.
And moral turpitude can destroy the most delicate of lives. Believe me, I know. I know.
Me own daughter, blinded in a drunken rage by my late husband. Her once beautiful eyes, pale and white as mistletoe berries.
And what, my friends, is your story? Will you be found wanting when the End of Days is come, when judgement rains down upon us all? Or will you be preserved against the coming apocalypse? Do not despair. I offer a way out. There is a different path. Sweetville!
Join us. Join us in this shining city on the hill. Bring me my bow of burning gold. Bring me my arrows of desire.
You wish to join us, my dear?
If it's all the same with you, ma'am.
Oh yes, dear. You'll do very nicely.
If our stratagem succeeds, Jenny will infiltrate deep into the black heart of this curious place.
And how will she locate the Doctor?
To find him, she needs only ignore all keep-out signs, go through every locked door, and run towards any form of danger that presents itself.
Business as usual, then.
Business as usual.
Did you think I'd forgotten you, dear monster, hmm?
I have travelled from London expressly to see Madame Vastra. If you'd be so kind as to announce me, my good man.
Whom shall I say is calling?
It asked for permission to enter and then it fell over. What are we to make of it?
I imagine Mister Thursday wants to know what progress we are making. The question is, how did the Doctor's image come to be preserved on a dead man's eye? It's a scientific impossibility. I wonder how Jenny is getting on.
If she hasn't made contact by nightfall, I suggest a massive frontal assault on the factory, madam. Casualties can be kept to perhaps as little as eighty percent.
I think there may be subtler ways of proceeding, Strax.
Suit yourself.
I'm dead nervous, aren't you? They have to be sure, you see. Only the best for Sweetville. I hope me teeth don't let me down. I'm Abigail.
Pleased to meet you.
You're not local, are you.
Nah. Up from London.
Different here, I bet.
Yeah. Like a bleeding horse market. Do you know anyone who's come to live here? In Sweetville, I mean.
I had a pal who come here three month back. She wrote to tell me how perfect it all were. Funny, though. I've not heard a peep from her since.
Next, please!
Hang on, we're moving.
What're you doing?
Do me a favour. Cause a distraction.
What?
Swoon. Have a funny turn. Fit of the vapours.
Are you crackers?
Go on. There's a guinea in it for you.
Done.
Them new manufacturers can do horrible things to a person. Horrible. I've pickled things in here that'd fair turn your hair snowy as top of Buckden Pike.
You know what I'm looking for.
Oh, aye. All them bits found in t'canal. The Crimson Horror.
It hardly seems possible.
Eh?
I think, I think I've seen these symptoms before.
Oh aye?
A long time ago.
Oh aye? How long?
About sixty five million years.
I trust you had a pleasant day, Mama?
Tolerable.
Will Mister Sweet ever join us for dinner, Mama?
Mister Sweet is rather tired tonight, I fear.
Dear me. How clumsy I'm getting.
To keep the Devil at bay.
All right, mate. You just stay calm now. I could open this door. Would you like that? Thought you might. But you and me has got to come to an arrangement. Savvy?
Now, you stand well back, do you hear me? I don't mean no harm to you, but you try anything funny and I'll leave you here to rot. Is that understood? Right.
Doctor!
What happened to you? Can't you speak?
Right. Right, we're getting out of here.
Come on. Come on!
Oh my god.
You are all I have, monster, but all will be well. Imperfect as we are, there will be room for us in the new Jerusalem.
No. No! Where are you, monster? Where are you?
What is it? You want to go in there?
Ah! Missed me?
Doctor!
Jenny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Just when you think your favourite lock-picking Victorian chambermaid will never turn up. Jenny.
[THE DOCTOR KISSES JENNY.]
[JENNY RIGHTFULLY SLAPS THE DOCTOR.]
You have no idea how good that feels. Right. Mrs Gillyflower. We've got to stop her. And then there's Clara. Poor Clara. Where's Clara?
Clara? Doctor, wait.
Can't. Clara. Got to find.
What happened to you? How long have you been like that?
Days, weeks, don't know. Long story. I'll keep it short.
Okay, so. Not London 1893. Yorkshire 1893. Near enough.
You're making a habit of this, getting us lost.
Sorry. It's much better than it used to be. Ooo, I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow Airport.
What for?
Search me. Anyway
Brave heart, Clara.
It's another one. Don't you see? Another victim. Why won't any one of you listen?
We'll listen.
Mrs Winifred Gillyflower. An astonishing woman. Prize winning chemist and mechanical engineer. So why
Why has she decided to open up a match factory in her old home town.
And no one who ever goes to live there ever seems to come out.
Same as the rest. All dead from causes unknown and their flesh glowing.
Like something manky in a coal cellar. They keep turning up in t'canal. The Crimson Horror.
Ooo, good name. Hey, that's good, isn't it? The Crimson Horror. I wonder what it is. Do you know the old Romany superstition, Clara? That the eye of a dead person retains an image of the last thing it sees. 
Nonsense, of course, unless the chemical composition of the body has been massively corrupted.
Wow, this is nasty. An organic poison. A sort of venom. And you think it's connected to Sweetville?
I do.
Well then, we need a plan.
Doctor and Mrs Smith. Oh yes, you'll do very nicely.
Oh, grand. Smashing. Eh, the missis and I couldn't be more chuffed, could we, love?
Sweetville will provide you with everything you need. You won't have to worry about a thing ever again.
The name, Sweetville.
Yes?
Why not name it after yourself. After all, it's your creation.
Gillyflowertown. Gillyflowerland. You could have roller coasters.
It is named in tribute to my partner.
Your late partner?
No, my silent partner. Mister Sweet likes to keep himself to himself. Shall we move on?
Who lives here?
Oh, names don't matter here. All you need to know is we only recruit the brightest and the best.
Like pretty maids all in a row. The process improves with every attempt. Mister Sweet is such a clever old thing. Oh, into the canal with the rejects, Ada.
Yes.
Ma.
Sometimes the preservation process goes wrong. Only Mister Sweet knows why, and only Mama is allowed to talk to Mister Sweet. But if you're very good, you can stay here. You'll be my secret. My special monster. Shush.
Poor Edmund must have come looking for us and then fallen into a vat of the pure venom. Or was pushed. Didn't stand a chance.
What is that stuff, though?
Deadly poison. And Mrs Gillyflower's been dipping her pilgrims in a dilute form to protect them. Preserve them. Process didn't work on me. Maybe because I'm not human. I ended up on the reject pile.
Preserve them against what?
Well, according to her, the coming apocalypse.
When the End of Days is come and judgement rains down upon us all.
What?
Nothing.
No, no, no. What?
Something Mrs Gillyflower said. One of her sermons. Madame will come looking for me. We'd best get on.
Yes, Clara. Got to find Clara.
But, Doctor. Clara's dead. Isn't she?
It's complicated.
Horse, you have failed in your mission. We are lost, with no sign of Sweetville. Do you have any final words before your summary execution? The usual story. Fourth one this week, and I'm not even hungry.
Sweetville, sir?
Do you know it?
Turn around when possible. Then, at the end of the road, turn right.
What?
Bear left for a quarter of a mile and you will have reached your destination.
Thank you. What is your name?
Thomas, sir. Thomas Thomas.
I think you will do well, Thomas Thomas.
Are we talking about the same person? About that Clara? Doctor!
I couldn't see much from where I was, but I think she survived the process. She must be here somewhere.
But Clara died. The Ice Lady? Doctor.
Well, it's er, it's complicated.
What is the meaning of this?
Oh, Mama, I have been foolish. I have formed a sentimental attachment.
An attachment? To whom?
A young man. Unlike the others, he survived rejection. He must be strong. Worthy of salvation.
Wrecker. Berserker! You have loosed a reject onto the outside world.
I have disappointed you.
My plans must be accelerated. Nothing must interfere with the Great Work.
But please say there is still room for me in your new Eden, Mama. Promise me that.
I'll set my pilgrims onto him.
No!
Kindly do not claw and slobber at my crinoline. You know I cannot bear to look at sick people.
Promise me you will not abandon me, Mama. Promise me that.
Do you not yet understand? There can be no place for people such as you. That only perfection is good enough for myself and Mister Sweet. The bright day is done, child, and you are for the dark.
Can she be revived, like you were?
I hope so.
Doctor.
Oh, great. Great. Attack of the supermodels. Time for a plan.
Nah, Doctor. This one's on me.
That is a plan.
Okay, time for a new plan. Run!
Sontar ha!
Let's go.
No, ma'am. We're not escaping. We've got to help the Doctor with Clara.
Long story.
What now, madam? We could lay mimetic cluster mines.
Strax.
Or dig trenches and fill them with acid.
Strax! You're overexcited. Have you been eating Miss Jenny's sherbet fancies again?
No.
Go outside and wait for me until I call for you.
But madam, I…
Go!
I'm going to go play with my grenades.
Okay, I think she's about done.
I know who you think she is, but she isn't. She can't be.
I was right, then. You and Clara have unfinished business.
There, there. Hello, stranger.
Doctor.
Ah ha.
Hi. What's going on?
Oh, haven't you heard, love? There's trouble at mill. She's a lizard.
My people once ruled this world, as well you know, but we did not rule it alone. Just as humanity fights a daily battle against nature, so did we. And our greatest plague, the most virulent enemy, was the repulsive red leech.
Ooo, the Repulsive Red Leech. Nah. On balance I think I prefer the Crimson Horror. What was it, exactly?
A tiny parasite. It infected our drinking water. And once in our systems, it secreted a fatal poison.
If it's been hanging around, lurking in the shadows, maybe it's evolved. Or maybe it's had help.
Doctor, I've been thinking. The chimney
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Way past that now. Yucky red parasite from the time of the dinosaurs pitches up in Victorian Yorkshire. Didn't see that one coming.
Yeah, but the chimney
But what's the connection to Mrs Gillyflower? Judgement will rain down on us all. An empty mill.
A chimney that doesn't blow smoke.
Clever clogs.
Missed me?
Yeah, lots.
She's going to poison the air.
How?
With that, I should think.
And there's the poison. All right, gang, I've got a plan.
Shush. Okay.
Who is that? Who is there?
You. It's you. My monster. You've come back. But you're
Warm. And alive, thanks to you, Ada. You saved me from your mother's human rubbish tip. Now then, what's wrong?
She does not want me, monster. I am not to be chosen. Perhaps it was my own sin, the blackness in my heart that my father saw in me.
Ada, no. That's nonsense. Stupid, backward nonsense, and you know it. You know it.
What is it?
Who is that?
I'm, I'm a friend. A friend of his.
Then you are fortunate indeed. It isn't good to be alone.
Now, Ada, I need you to tell me something. Who is Mister Sweet? Ada?
Oh, dear monster
Please, tell me.
I cannot. Even now, I cannot. I cannot betray Mama.
Well, come with us, then. There's something you need to know.
Oh, you do seem to keep turning up like a bad penny, young man.
Force of habit.
Can I offer you something? Tea? Seed cake? Oh, a glass of Amontillado?
No, thanks. We've had a skinful already, as you might say.
Ha, ha. Very funny.
Yes. I'm the Doctor, you're nuts and I'm going to stop you.
I'm afraid Mister Sweet and I cannot allow that.
Ah, yes. Would it be impolite to ask why you and Mister Sweet are petrifying your workforce with diluted prehistoric leech venom?
So, when do we get to meet him, this silent partner of yours? Why's he so shy.
Mister Sweet is always with us.
You seem to have a very close relationship, you and your pal.
Oh yes, Doctor. Exceedingly close. Symbiotic, you might say.
Doctor, what is it?
A survivor. He has grown fat on the filth humanity has pumped into the rivers. That's where I found him.
Very enterprising.
His needs are simple, and in return he gives me his nectar.
Mrs Gillyflower, you have no idea what you are dealing with. In the wrong hands, that venom could wipe out all life on this planet.
Do you know what these are? Ha, ha! The wrong hands.
Planning a little fireworks party, are we?
You have forced me to advance the Great Work somewhat, Doctor, but my colossal scheme remains as it was. My rocket will explode high in the atmosphere, raining down Mister Sweet's beneficence onto all humanity.
And wiping us all out. You can't!
My new Adam and Eves will sleep for but a few months before stepping out into a golden dawn. Is it not beautiful, Doctor?
Now, tell us about Ada, Mrs Gillyflower.
What?
Your daughter. You do remember your daughter? Tell us about your daughter.
How can you speak of such trivia when my hour is at hand? The child is of no consequence.
Is that why you experimented on her?
Experimented?
The signs are all there. The pattern of scarring. You used her as a guinea pig, didn't you.
God.
Sometimes sacrifices must be made.
Sacrifices?
It was necessary. I had to find out how much of the venom would produce an anti-toxin to immunise myself. Don't you see? It was necessary!
Mama? Is it, is it true?
Ada.
It is. It's true. True.
Ada, listen to me.
You hag! You perfidious hag! You virago! You harpy!
All these years I have helped you, served you, looked after you. Do they count for nothing, nothing at all?
No, stop. Stop.
Hang on, I've got a sonic screwdriver.
Yeah? I've got a chair!
No!
Yeah. That worked. I'm afraid your rocket isn't going anywhere, Mrs G.
Please, come to me, Ada. Oh, my child. You have always been so very useful.
No, Mrs Gillyflower.
Please, Mama. No more. No more.
And now, if you'll please forgive us, we must be going. It is long past Ada's bedtime.
No, no, Clara. If we follow straight after her, she'll shoot Ada on the spot.
She wouldn't.
She would. Chairs are useful.
Come along, Ada. Don't dawdle.
Please, Mama, stop.
Has the venom been loaded?
Yes, ma'am.
Then heaven awaits you.
Stop!
Just let her go, Mrs Gillyflower. Let Ada go.
Secondary firing mechanism, Doctor. Mister Sweet and I are too smart for you, after all.
Just let your daughter go, Mrs Gillyflower.
Ada!
Shoot if you wish, Mama. It is of no matter, for you killed me a long time ago.
I'll labour night and day to be a pilgrim.
Now, Mister Sweet, now the whole world will taste your lethal kiss!
I don't think so, Mrs Gillyflower.
Very well, then. If I can't take the world with me, you will have to do. Die, you freaks. Die! Die!
Put down your weapon, human female.
Ouch.
No. No. Mister Sweet, where are you going? You can't leave me now, Mister Sweet.
What's it doing?
It knows she's dying. She's no longer of any use to it.
Mister Sweet. Ada?
Ada. Are you there?
I'm here, Mama.
Forgive me, my child. Forgive me.
Never.
That's my girl.
What will you do with that thing?
Take it back to the Jurassic era, maybe. Out of harm's way.
On the other hand…
Right. Right, London. We were heading for London, weren't we?
Was there any particular reason?
No. No. Just thought you might like it.
Yeah. Maybe had enough of Victorian values for a bit.
You're the boss.
Am I?
No. No. Get in.
Now, Ada, I'd love to stay and help clear up the mess, but…
I know, dear monster. You have things to do.
And what about you?
Oh, there are many things a bright young lady can do to occupy her time. It's time I stepped out of the darkness and into the light.
Good luck, Ada. You know, I think you will be just Splendid.
Well, thanks a million, you three, as ever. Have some Pontefract cakes on me. I love Pontefract cakes. See you around, eh, I shouldn't wonder.
But Doctor. That girl, Clara. You haven't explained.
No, I haven't.
Ah, look at the muck in here. Right!
Another one for the vault.
Ah, there you are. I called to see whether there had been any progress.
The boss. Yep, that's me.
I am the boss.
It's you, isn't it. It's from the seventies, but it's definitely you.
Of course it's not.
And that's you too, from 1983. I found it at school.
No, that's just someone who looks like me.
And that's someone that looks like your boyfriend.
Is he an alien?
Why would he be an alien?
The chin.
And the time travel?
That's not right.
You were in Victorian London.
No, I was in Victorian Yorkshire.
How come you didn't tell us?
Time travel, that's so cool.
Can we have a go?
Can you have a what?
We want a shot at the time machine.
No, no, no, no. Listen
Okay. Or, we'll have to tell Dad that our nanny's a time traveller.
"""NIGHTMARE IN SILVER""
11 May 2013 — 07x12
—written by Neil Gaiman"
Well, here we are. Hedgewick's World. The biggest and best amusement park there will ever be, and we've got a golden ticket. Eh? Eh? Fun.
Fun?
Your stupid box can't even get us to the right place. This is like a moon base or something.
It's not the moon.
Actually, I think it does look like the moon, only dirtier.
Hey. Guys. It's not the moon, okay? It's a Spacey Zoomer ride, or it was.
Psst. Excuse I. I don't suppose you happen to be my lift off planet? Dave's Discount Interstellar Removals?
Afraid not.
They were meant to be here six months ago. Well, that's Dave for you, see? Unreliable.
Stay where you are!
Oops.
Throw down your weapons and identify yourselves.
No. No weapons. Golden ticket. Spacey Zoomer. Free ice cream?
Who are you? This planet is closed, by Imperial order.
How's this?
Oh. Welcome, Proconsul. I wish they'd told us you were coming. Any news of the Emperor?
Oh, the Emperor. No, no. None that you'd er
We pray for his return. If there is anything you need, my platoon is at your service.
Right. Righty-o. Well, carry on, Captain.
Platoon, let's move out! On the double. Two, three, four. Two, three, four. Two, three, four.
Have they gone?
Yes.
Uniforms give me the heebie-jeebies. Come on. They can't stop me being here, but they don't like it.
Ha, ha! You see? I told you it was amazing. Well, it used to be.
It closed down. Wish I'd known that before I landed here. But let me show you my collection. Come along. Follow me. This way. This way in, come on.
Welcome to my show. Webley's World of Wonders. Miracles, marvels and more await you. I am Impresario Webley. You see before you waxwork representations of the famous and the infamous. Anybody here play chess?
Perhaps you, young man?
Actually, I'm in my school chess club.
Ah. Follow me.
Now, let demonstrate to you all the wonder of the age, the miracle of modernity.
We defeated them all a thousand years ago, but now he's back, to destroy you. Behold, the enemy!
Cyberman! Get down!
No need to panic, my young friends. We all know there are no more living Cybermen. What you are seeing is a miracle. The six hundred and ninety ninth wonder of the universe, as displayed before the Imperial court, and only here to destroy you at chess.
Careful now. An empty shell, and yet it moves. How?
Magic.
That might well be, young lady, but a single penny wins you five Imperial shillings
If you can beat this empty shell at chess.
I haven't got a penny, but I've got a sandwich.
All right, take a seat. It is free of all devices, and yet it has never been beaten. Would you like to make the first move, young man?
Oh no, Artie. No, don't do that, it…
That's a fool's mate.
If you can tell me how it works, I'll give you a silver penny.
I think you do it with mirrors?
Hmm. Mirrors. Clever girl. Well, let's see, hey? Low tech. It's a puppet. Monofilament strings, which means the brains are in
Hello
I'm the brains.
Hello.
Give us a hand.
They call me Porridge. Oh, it's good to be out of that box.
For you, Miss, an Imperial penny.
I have not one but three Cybermen in my collection.
Is that the King?
Emperor. Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, etc, etc, the forty first. Defender of Humanity, Imperator of known space.
He looks a bit full of himself.
Don't say things like that about the Imperial family. You can end up on the run for the rest of your life.
They don't sound very nice.
Go on. If the kids want to ride the Spacey Zoomer, then I can operate the gravity console.
Angie!
Wow!
Smile! Say, Spacey Zoomer.
Look at us, Doctor. We're flying!
Having a good time?
I think that was the most fun I've had in my whole life.
It was... okay.
Clara, I think outer space is actually very interesting.
Right. Wonderful day out, Doctor, but time to get the kids home.
Yeah. Er, no. Not actually ready to leave.
Why not?
I don't know. Reasons.
What reasons?
Insects. Funny insects. I should add them to my funny insect collection.
You collect funny insects?
Yeah, I'm starting to, right now.
How long do we have to stay here?
Not long. Have a nap. I'll wake you when we're ready to leave.
Comfy?
Sleep well.
Good night.
Don't wander off. Now, I'm not just saying don't wander off, I mean it. Otherwise, you'll wander off and the next thing you know, somebody's going to have to start rescuing somebody.
From what?
Nothing. Nobody needs rescuing from anything. Don't wander off. Sweet dreams.
Total takings for the day, one sandwich. Better than no sandwich, of course. Not as good as two sandwiches, or even a chicken.
That's a bit odd. That's not funny. Give me my hands back.
Upgrade in progress.
I hate the future. It's stupid. There's not even phone service. I'm out of here.
The Doctor said not to wander off.
He said that, and then he wandered off.
I don't think Clara would like that.
She's not our mum.
Don't leave me here.
Was this really the biggest amusement park in the universe?
Yeah. Hedgewick bought the planet cheap. It'd been trashed in the Cyberwars.
Who were we fighting?
Cybermen. Technologically upgraded warriors. We couldn't win. Sometimes we fought to a draw, but then they'd upgrade themselves, fix their weaknesses and destroy us. It's hard to fight an enemy that uses your armies as spare parts.
You beat them, though. Beat them or you wouldn't be here. How?
Look up there. That corner of sky? What do you see?
Nothing. It's just black. No stars, no nothing.
It used to be the Tiberion Spiral Galaxy. A million star systems, a hundred million worlds, a billion trillion people. It's not there anymore. No more Tiberion Galaxy. No more Cybermen. It was effective.
It's horrible.
Yeah. I feel like a monster sometimes.
Why?
Because instead of mourning a billion trillion dead people, I just feel sorry for the poor blighter who had to press the button and blow it all up.
Clara, did you tell Angie she could go to the barracks?
You know I didn't. She hasn't.
She's just gone in there.
Come on.
I can't fix this.
It can't be broken. It's a solid state subether ansible class communicator. Just run the diagnostics.
There's nothing left to diagnose. It's not broken, it's empty. All the components have gone.
Well, you must have replacement parts.
Not enough to build a new one.
Captain, the weather controller is malfunctioning again. There's storms, heat waves, snow.
Hello, I'm bored.
Where's your big sister?
Clara? She's not my sister. She's stupid. She's talking to Porridge.
She talks to her porridge?
Porridge. That little bloke?
We need to have a chat.
I'm not scared, if you're wondering. I just think I ought to turn the lights back on.
So, tell me about the little bloke.
Well, you must have seen him.
Angie! Angie!
She always has to turn up and spoil everything. I wasn't doing anything. Why can't you just leave me alone?
Cyberman!
Angie!
Attack formation.
No! Attack formation, quickly.
Upgrade in progress.
Angie!
Clara. Clara!
That was a Cyberman. But they're extinct.
Listen to me. I will get her back. Captain, a word please. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I take it your platoon doesn't do much fighting.
What do you expect?
What?
We're a punishment platoon. It's why they sent us out here, so we can't get into trouble.
Right, right, well, okay. As Imperial Consul, I'm putting Clara in charge.
Clara, stay alive until I get back, and don't let anyone blow up this planet.
Is that something they're likely to do?
Get to somewhere defensible.
Where are you going?
I'm getting Angie, finding Artie and looking for funny insects. Stay alive. And you lot, no blowing up this planet!
Put me down! I hate you!
Artie? Artie, what's happening?
Please stand by. You will be upgraded.
Cyberiad class weaponry. I've taken it out of storage.
Good. We need to find somewhere defensible. Where?
The beach, the Giant's Cauldron, Natty Longshoe's Comical Castle.
Real castle? Drawbridge? Moat?
Yes, but comical.
We'll go there.
Ma'am, my platoon can deal with one Cyberman, and there are protocols if we cannot immediately find and destroy it.
Blowing up the planet protocols?
Respectfully, ma'am.
Somewhere defensible. No blowing up the planet.
She's your commanding officer now, isn't she, Captain?
Yes. Sir.
You really saw a Cyberman?
We really did.
Have you reported it to the Imperium?
No communicators.
So you're going to do what she says. Right, let's all spend the night at Natty Longshoe's Comical Castle.
Artie?
Firstly, if anybody's watching this, those children are under my protection. I'm coming to get them. And secondly, little metal machine, you are beautiful.
Not even a Cybermat any more, eh? Cybermites.
Now, there's a local transmat link open to your home. If I can just find the frequency...
Hey, that really shouldn't have worked.
Doctor, help us.
Angie? Artie?
Webley.
We needed children, but the children had stopped coming. You brought us children. Hail to you, the Doctor, saviour of the Cybermen!
What would the Empire do if they were alerted?
I told you, tell me to blow up the planet.
After they got us off.
Captain, you want to take that one?
No, ma'am. Just blow the sucker up.
Drawbridge, moat, brilliant.
With respect, ma'am, we ought to be hunting the creature.
The only reason I'm still alive is that I do what the Doctor says. Can you guarantee me you'd bring back my children alive and unharmed?
I trust the Doctor.
You think he knows what he's doing?
I'm not sure I'd go that far.
As the battle raged between humanity and the Cyberiad, the Cyberplanners built a Valkyrie, to save critically damaged units and bring them here, and one by one, repair them.
The people who vanished from the amusement park, they were spare parts for repairs.
We've upgraded ourselves. The next model will be undefeatable.
Nothing's undefeatable.
We needed children to build a new Cyberplanner. A child's brain, with its infinite potential, is perfect for our needs. But we no longer need the children. The Cybermites have been scanning your brain, Doctor. It's quite remarkable.
Also completely useless to you. Cybermen use human parts. I'm not human. You can't convert non-humans.
Well, that was true a long time ago. But we've upgraded ourselves. Current Cyberunits use almost any living components.
Incorporated. Yes. Ah. Unfamiliar pulmonary set-up. Nervous system hyperconductive. Remarkable brain processing speed. Ho, ho. Amazing.
Get out of my head!
Stop rummaging in my mind.
Just you try and stop me. Ooo, who's Clara. Why are you thinking about her so much?
Enough.
Fascinating. A complete mental block. Highly effective.
Relax, relax. If you just relax, you will find this a perfectly pleasant experience. You are being upgraded and incorporated into the Cyberiad as a Cyberplanner.
Get out of my head!
What is this place, a network? A hive? You're getting signals from every Cyberman everywhere. How many of you are there?
Oh, this is brilliant. I'm so clever already, and now I'm a million times more clever. And what a brain. Not a human brain, not even slightly human. I mean, I'm going to have to completely rework the neural interface, but this is going to be the most efficient Cyberplanner. Not a great name, that, is it? I could call myself Mister Clever. So much raw data. Time Lords. There's information on the Time Lords in here. Oh, this is just dreamy.
Right, I'm allowing you access to memories on Time Lord regeneration.
Fantastic!
I could regenerate right now. A big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyberwidgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. You use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can.
Stalemate, then. One of us needs to control this head. We're too well-balanced. What did you say? No, no, no, no, no. I heard you. Rhetorical device to keep me thinking about it a bit more. Stalemate?
We each control forty nine point eight eight one percent of this brain. Point two three eight of the brain is still in the balance. Whoever gets this gets the whole thing.
Do you play chess?
The rules of chess are in my memory banks. You're proposing we play chess to end the stalemate?
Winner takes all. Nobody can access that portion of the brain without winning the game.
You can't win.
Try me.
You understand, when I do win, the Cyberiad gets your brains and memories. All of it.
When I win, you get out of my head, you let the children go, and nobody dies. You got that? Nobody dies!
Castle's clear. Missy, confirm status.
All clear in the power station.
It's Missy. Something's out there.
What do you mean? Is it the Cyberman?
I don't know. I couldn't see it. It was only for a moment. Can I hide? Is it okay if I hide?
Don't move! I'm in the army!
Er, ma'am. Missy said she saw something, and then she went quiet.
It's on its way, then. Weapons. Show me. Only one gun?
Cybermen have been extinct for a thousand years. Even one Anti-Cyber gun is a miracle. These things are hand-pulsers. Touch the back of a Cyberman's head, the electomagnetic pulse deactivates it.
What's this for? Just a mad guess here, it blows up the planet?
Implodes it. There's also a trigger unit.
I'll have that, then. Is there any other way to activate the bomb?
It's set to respond to my voice. I have the verbal code.
You will not activate it without a direct order from me.
I will follow my orders.
Your orders come from me, don't they?
You'll need to sign for that trigger unit, ma'am.
Thanks.
Mind if I take one of these? Might be handy.
Help yourself. I'll teach you how to use it. Upstairs. Now!
There. That was easy. The game has just started. Doctor, why is there no record of you anywhere in the databanks of the Cyberiad? Oh, you're good. Oh, you've been eliminating yourself from history. You know you could be reconstructed by the hole you've left.
Good point. I'll do something about that.
The rules of chess allow only a finite number of moves, and I can use other Cyberunits as remote processors. You cannot possibly win.
I can. I know things you don't. For example, did you know very early versions of the Cyber operating system could be seriously scrambled by exposure to things, like gold, or cleaning fluid? And what's interesting is, you're still running some of that code.
Really. That's your secret weapon? Cleaning fluid?
Nope, gold.
Oh ho, ho! Like a charm. Right, you, Cyber Webley, and you kid things. I'll bring the chessboard. Let's get out of here.
You knew it was me.
I was in the Imperial Guard on Caspertine. Mostly just parades, but I had the honour to guard the old Emperor during the ice picnic.
When the snow bears came and danced for us. That was a day.
We're a punishment platoon. We can't beat a Cyberman. The Imperium has to know what's happening.
Like you said, the communicators are out. The only way you can report this now is to activate the bomb.
Yes.
And I forbid you to do that.
I don't get it. Why would you blow up a whole planet and everybody on it just to get rid of one Cyberman?
We tried other ways, but they only work sometimes, so now we take drastic action. And it works.
If you find a Cyberman and you can't destroy it immediately, you implode the planet. I was sent here because I didn't follow orders. I can make up for that.
Put it down. I forbid you.
Yeah. What she said.
You ran away. I will do what I was brought up to do. Live for the Empire, fight for the Empire, die for the Empire. This is Captain Alice Ferrin, Imperial ID one nine delta one three B. Activate
Cyberman! Get down!
The Doctor said to get somewhere easily defensible, but if we just stay in the castle it'll pick us off one by one. We have to take it out.
Is that an order, ma'am?
Yes.
Good.
You know what to do.
Pulse to the back of the head. Fry the brain circuit interface.
It's going to be hard to get in close enough.
I've heard about the Cybermen since I was in my cradle. I'm not afraid of you.
Now!
Hold it right there.
What's happening to them?
One more step and I fire.
Don't fire that. A pulse will deactivate them.
And anyway, it's a waste of charge. We may need it again.
You don't think that was the only one, then?
Argh! Don't shoot, don't shoot, I'm nice. Please, don't shoot. Hey, Clara, you haven't let them blow up the planet. Good job.
Did you get the kids? Are they all right? What's going on?
Er, a bit of a good news, bad news, good news again thing going on. So, good news, I've kidnapped the Cyberplanner and right now I'm sort of in control of this Cyberman.
Bad news?
Bad news, the Cyberplanner's in my head. And, different bad news, the kids are, well, it's complicated.
Complicated how?
Complicated as in walking coma.
Please tell me you can wake them up.
Hope so.
Other good news?
Well, in other good news, there are a few more repaired and reactivated Cybermen on the way, and the Cyberplanner's installing a patch for the gold thing. No, wait, that isn't good news, is it. Er, so, good news, I have a very good chance of winning my chess match.
What?
I'll explain later. In a bit of a hurry. Get me to a table, and somebody tie me up! Need hands free for chess. And immobilise me, quickly.
Right, that's good. I won't be able to move, but hands free. Good.
You're playing chess with yourself?
And winning.
Actually, he has no better than a twenty five percent chance of winning at this stage in the game. Some very dodgy moves at the beginning.
Hello, flesh girl. Fantastic. I'm the Cyberplanner.
Doctor?
Afraid not. I'm working the mouth now. Allons-y. Oh, you should see the state of these neurons. He's had some cowboys in here. Ten complete re-jigs.
You aren't the Doctor.
No, but I know who you are. You're the impossible girl. Oh, he's very interested in you.
Why am I impossible?
Hasn't he told you? The sly devil. Oh, dear me. Listen, soon we'll wake. We'll strip you down for spare parts, then build a spaceship and move on.
More Cybermen.
They're waking from their tomb right now. You can either die or live on as one of us.
The Doctor will stop you.
He can't even access the lips.
Argh! Ow! Oh, that hurt. No, stop. Enough, Bit of pain, neural surge. Just what I needed. Thank you.
Why am I the impossible girl?
It's just a thing in my head. I'll explain later.
Chess game. Stakes?
If he wins, I give up my mind and he gets access to all my memories, along with knowledge of time travel. But, if I win, he'll break his promises to get out of my head and then kill us all anyway.
That's not reassuring.
No.
Please tell me you can fix whatever happened to the children.
Children. Yeah. They're fine. I mean, right now their brains are just in stand by mode.
That is not fine!
Listen, right now they have a much better chance of getting out of this situation alive than you do.
Which one of you said that?
Me. Cyberplanner. Mister Clever. Now, if you don't mind, I have a chess game to finish, and you have to die, pointlessly and very far from home. Toodle-oo.
Apparently there are more Cybermen on the way.
There's at least a dozen more shots left in the gun before it needs to recharge.
We might have more than a dozen Cybermen to worry about. What's that cable?
Power line for the park.
What wouldd happen if we unhooked the end, dropped it into the moat and turned it on?
Fry anything alive that entered the water.
Can Cybermen fly?
No, ma'am.
First good news of the day. Do it.
Stop that. I felt that.
Of course you did. It's time to get up. Wakey, wakey, boys and girls. Wakey, wakey.
There, get that in you. Warm you up.
Oh, thank you, Porridge.
Oi, Clara!
I'll see what he wants. Call me if there's any change.
Right.
Hey! Clara, there you are. Now, quick rundown. What's our weapons strength?
One big gun, five of those hand-pulser units and a shiny black bomb that implodes the planet.
Yeah. Yeah, that one. Now, tell me, does it happen possibly to have a remote triggery thing?
Brilliant. Pass it here.
No.
Why not?
In case you're not you right now. Or even if you are, just in case.
Oh, don't worry. The Cyberplanner's hibernating between moves right now. Shush.
Prove you're you. Tell me something only the Doctor knows.
Clara, I suppose I'm the only one who knows how I feel about you right now. How funny you are. So funny. And pretty. And the truth is, I'm starting to like you in a way that is more than just
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Yes! It's me. That really hurt. How did you know that was him?
Because even if that was true, which it is obviously not, I know you well enough to know that you would rather die than say it. Finish your stupid game.
Doctor, let go.
I can't. He's got control of the left arm. Argh, argh, no! No!
Doctor?
He got what he wanted. He destroyed the trigger. My move.
What do you mean, he got what he wanted?
He means, good news, boys and girls. They're here!
One gun, five hand-pulsers and a planet smashing bomb that doesn't work any more.
Why not?
Broken trigger unit.
But you signed for that.
I've learned so much from you, Doctor. It's been an education. But now, it's time for the endgame.
Brilliant.
Upgrade in progress.
Damn. Who's our best shot?
Probably it's me.
Shoot any of them who make it across. The rest of you, take defensive positions. Porridge?
Yes?
Keep yourself safe.
Alice Ferrin, you should have destroyed this planet when you had the chance.
They're nearly here. Now, you can take my bishop and keep limping on for a little longer, or you can sacrifice your queen and get the children back. But it's mate in five moves, and I get your mind.
Takes my queen, and give me back the children.
Emotions. Can't you see what a foolish move that was? You've lost the game.
Kids back now.
Emotions, Doctor, all for two human children you barely know. And it was a pointless sacrifice anyway. So, Doctor, do you think the children's death will affect your relationship with Miss Clara?
Welcome to Webley's World of Wonders, children. Now presenting delights, delicacies, and death.
Doctor!
Angie, are you okay? Just look after Artie, okay?
Your move. But before you take it, just so you know, sacrificing my queen was the best possible move I could have made. The Time Lords invented chess. It's our game. And if you don't avoid my trap, it gives me mate in three moves.
How?
I've got no charge left.
How?
Oh, come on. Call yourself a chess playing robot?
How!
You figure it out. Or don't you have the processing power, hmm?
Please stand by. You will be upgraded. Welcome to the Cyberiad. You will be upgraded. Welcome to the Cyberiad. You will be upgraded.
What are you doing?
Doctor. Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. I'm pulling in extra processing power. Three million Cyberbrains are working on one tiny chess problem. How long do you think it's going to take us to solve it?
That's cheating.
No, no, no, no, no. Just pulling in the local resources.
There's no way you can get to mate in three moves.
Three moves. Want to know what they are?
You're lying.
Move one, turn on sonic screwdriver. Move two, activate pulser. Move three, amplify pulser. See you.
That's cheating!
Just taking advantage of the local resources. Ah, hello. Can someone untie me, please?
Do you think I'm pretty?
No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny.
Good enough. What happened to the Cyberplanner?
Out of my head and redistributed across three million Cybermen right now, and about to wake them all up, kill us and start constructing a spaceship. We need to destroy this planet before they can get off it.
Okay, it has a fallback voice activation.
The Captain, but she's dead.
I think you should ask Porridge.
Why?
Well, he is the Emperor. I bet he knows the activation codes. Oh, come on. It's obvious. He looks exactly like he does on the coin, and on the waxwork, except they made him a bit taller, but look, am I the only one paying attention to anything around here?
You are full of surprises. Porridge?
She's right.
So you can save us?
We all die in the end. Does it matter how?
What do we do?
I don't want to be Emperor. If I activate that bomb, it's all over.
And if you don't, three million Cybermen will spread across the galaxy. Isn't that worth dying for?
Doctor
Three million Cybermen!
The bomb, the throne, it's all connected. I just have to say this is Emperor Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, called Longstaff the forty first, the Defender of Humanity, Imperator of known space. Activate the Desolator. And it's done.
It'll blow in about eighty seconds. Easily long enough for the Imperial Flagship to locate me from my identification, warp jump into orbit, and transmat us to the State Room.
Oh yeah. Nice ship. Bit big. Not blue enough. Listen, there is a large blue box at coordinates six ultra nineteen P. I need it transmatted up here right away.
Right. Did you get that?
And that's that. Seventy six, seventy seven, seventy eight, seventy nine...
[THE PLANET EXPLODES.]
Farewell, Cyberiad. You know, it was good to get away. Good to be a person and not to be lonely, or Emperor of a thousand galaxies with everyone waiting for me to tell them what to do.
Can't you run away again?
They'll be keeping a close eye on me this time. That's what happens when you're Emperor. Loneliest job in the universe.
You don't have to be lonely.
I don't. Clara, will you marry me?
What?
He said
She heard what he said.
You're smart and you're beautiful, and I've never met anyone like you before. And being Emperor won't be as hard if you're by my side. And you'd rule a thousand galaxies.
This sounds like an actual marriage proposal. Tricky. Now, if you want my advice
You, not one word. This is between me and the Emperor. Porridge, I don't want to rule a thousand galaxies.
Yeah. Silly of me.
I'm really sorry.
But that's stupid. You could be Queen of the universe. How can you say no to that? When someone asks you if you want to be Queen of the universe, you say yes. You watch. One day, I'll be Queen of the universe.
Of course, I could have you all executed, which is what a proper Emperor would do.
You're not actually going to do that, though, are you? Oh, you're. Hey?
Go on, get out of here, all of you, before I change my mind.
Thank you for having me. It was very interesting.
My pleasure. Thank you for coming. Now, I've got something for you. It's not from me, it's from the Tardis. Ah. New phone.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Sorry I said this box was stupid.
Bye.
Bye. Thanks, Clara.
Thanks, Clara's boyfriend.
Thank you, Doctor.
For what?
Kid's day out. Getting us off the planet alive. Whatever you were doing with the Cybermen. Good night. See you next Wednesday.
Well, a Wednesday, definitely. Next Wednesday, last Wednesday
One of the Wednesdays. Impossible girl. A mystery wrapped in an enigma squeezed into a skirt that's just a little bit too tight. Oh yeah. What are you?
Signs of any Cybertech remaining?
No, Majesty.
You ever wanted to be Emperor, Gloria?
No, Majesty
That's the right answer. Come on. Let's go home.
"""THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR""
18 May 2013 — 07x13
—written by Steven Moffat"
One day you meet the Doctor. And of course, it's the best day ever. It's just the best day of your life. Because, because he's brilliant, and he's funny, and mad, and best of all, he really needs you.
The trick is, don't fall in love. I do that trick quite a lot, sometimes twice a day. And once you start running, you start to forget, slowly.
After a while, you just stop asking. Who are you? Where are you from? What set you on your way and where are you going? Oh, and what is your name? You get used to not knowing. I thought I never would. I was wrong.
I know who he is. I know how he began and I know where he's going. I know the truth about the Doctor and his greatest secret. The day we went to Trenzalore.
From the beginning, she was impossible. The Impossible Girl.
I met her in the Dalek Asylum. Never saw her face, and she died. I met her again in Victorian London, and she died. Saved my life both times, by giving her own.
But now she's back and we're running together, and she's perfect. Perfect in every way for me. Except she can't remember that we ever met.
Clara. My Clara. Always brave, always funny, always exactly what I need. Perfect. Too perfect.
Get used to not knowing. I thought I never would. I was wrong.
I know who Clara Oswald is. I know how she came to be in my life, and I know what she will always mean. I found out the day we went to Trenzalore.
Something wrong?
It's the repair shop. What kind of idiot would steal a faulty Tardis?
Doctor? Doctor?
Yes, what is it? What do you want?
Sorry, but you're about to make a very big mistake.
I don't know where I am. It's like I'm breaking into a million pieces and there's only one thing I remember. I have to save the Doctor. He always looks different.
Doctor!
But I always know it's him. Sometimes I think I'm everywhere at once, running every second just to find him.
Doctor!!
Just to save him.
Doctor!!
Doctor?
But he never hears me.
Oi.
Almost never. I blew into this world on a leaf.
I'm still blowing.
I don't think I'll ever land.
I'm Clara Oswald. I'm the Impossible Girl. I was born to save the Doctor.
Do you hear the Whisper Men? The Whisper Men are near. If you hear the Whisper Men, then turn away your ear. Do not hear the Whisper men, whatever else you do. For once you've heard the Whisper Men, they'll stop and look at you. One word from you could save me from the rope.
Then you may rely on my silence.
I have information. Valuable information.
Are you bargaining for your life? You have the blood of fourteen women on your hands. There are no words you can speak that will save your neck.
The Doctor. Ah, yes. I know all about him, your dangerous friend.
How?
In the babble of the world, there are whispers, if you know how to listen. The Doctor has a secret, you know.
He has many.
He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered. Well?
We can't let that terrible man live.
He lives till I understand what he told me. We're going to need a conference call. I'll send out the invitations, you fetch the candles.
Yes, ma'am.
Where's Strax got to?
The usual. It's his weekend off.
I wish he'd never discovered that place.
Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!
Come here while I kill ye, ya filthy wee midden.
Prepare to die in agony for the glory of the Sontaran Empire!
Excuse me. Mister Strax?
What is it, girl? Can't you see I'm trying to crush the brains of this stinking primitive? Sorry about this.
No problem.
It's a telegram, sir. Very urgent.
Conference call. Sorry, Archie. I'm going to have to ask you to render me unconscious.
Fine.
Better use this.
It might take a while.
Sleep well, my love.
You too.
The trap is set for the Doctor's friends. They will travel where the Doctor ends.
Oh, I like the new desktop.
I was getting a little bored of the Taj Mahal. The tea should be superb. It's drawn from one of my favourite memories. Strax, good of you to join us.
It had better be important. I was in the middle of destroying some very pleasant primitives.
I apologise for the interruption, but there is urgent news concerning the Doctor.
Who else is coming?
The women.
Oh, no. You're going to try and make a soufflé again, aren't you?
My mum's soufflé, yeah. Although this time I'll get it right. This time I will be Soufflé Girl.
How can it be your mum's soufflé if you're making it?
Because, Artie, it's like my mum always said. The soufflé isn't the soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe.
Was your mum deep on puddings?
She was a great woman.
What's this?
Oh, it arrived today. It's for you.
My dearest Clara. The Doctor entrusted me with your contact details in the event of an emergency, and I fear one has now arisen.
Assuming this letter will have reached you as planned, on April 10th, 2013, please find and light the enclosed candle. It will release a soporific which will induce a trance state, enabling direct communication across the years.
However, as I realise you have no reason to trust this letter, I have taken the liberty of embedding the same soporific into the fabric of the paper you are now holding. Speak soon.
So glad you could make it.
Where am I?
Exactly where you were, but sleeping.
Time travel has always been possible in dreams. We are awaiting only one more participant.
Oh, no. Not the one with the gigantic head?
It's hair, Strax.
Hair.
Madame Vastra.
Professor. Help yourself to some tea.
Why, thank you.
[RIVER CREATES A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE OUT OF THIN AIR.]
How did you do that?
Disgracefully.
Ah. Perhaps you two haven't met. This is the Doctor's companion. That is, his current travelling assistant.
Assistant?
Have you gone a darker green?
Clara Oswald.
Professor River Song. The Doctor might have mentioned me?
Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, of course he has. Professor Song. Sorry, it's just I never realised you were a woman.
[RIVER IS ALREADY PLANNING ON HOW TO KILL THE DOCTOR. AGAIN.]
Well, neither did I.
Perhaps we should get down to the business at hand.
That might be good, dear, yes.
Clarence DeMarco. Murderer, under sentence of death. He offered us this in exchange for his life.
Space time coordinates.
This, Mister DeMarco claims, is the location of the Doctor's greatest secret.
Which is?
We don't know. It's a secret.
The Doctor does not discuss his secrets with anyone, my dear. If you're still entertaining the idea that you are an exception to this rule, ask yourself one question. What is his name?
Well, I know it.
What, you know his name? He told you?
I made him.
How?
It took a while.
So you're a friend of his, then?
A little more than a friend, a long time ago.
He's still never contacted you?
He doesn't like endings.
So what else did this DeMarco tell you? He didn't just buy his life with some coordinates. How did he prove their value?
One word, only.
What word?
A word I've heard in connection with the Doctor before. Trenzalore.
How exactly did he describe what he was giving you?
The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered.
You misunderstood.
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I just realise I forgot to lock the doors.
It doesn't matter, Jenny. What misunderstanding? Tell me.
No, ma'am, please. I should've locked up before we went into the trance.
Jenny, it doesn't matter!
Someone's broken in. Someone's with us. I can hear them.
Jenny, are you all right?
Sorry, ma'am. So sorry. So sorry. So sorry. I think I've been murdered.
Jenny!
What's happened to her.
Jenny, can you hear me?
Speak to us, boy!
Jenny!!
You're under attack. You must wake up now. Just wake up. Do it!
[RIVER SLAPS VASTRA.]
Who are you? What have you done to her?
You too, Strax. Wake up now!
Tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor.
Tell him what?
His friends are lost for ever more, unless he goes to Trenzalore.
No! You can't say that. He can't go there. You know he can't.
Angie? Artie?
The Doctor can never go to Trenzalore.
Am I getting warm?
Angie? Artie? Am I getting warm? Am I getting warm?
Am I getting warm? Look, I'm pretty sure you have to tell me if I'm getting warm. I'm, I'm, I'm pretty sure that's in the rules.
Doctor?
Ha! Clara. How are you? Don't worry, everything is under control.
What are you doing?
Oh. Mr. Maitland went next door, so I said I'd look after the kids. They wanted to go to the cinema, but I said no. I said no, not until you wake up. I was very firm.
At which point they suggested Blind Man's Buff.
Yes. Where are they?
At the cinema.
The little Daleks.
What's wrong?
So who was she, the lady with the funny name and the space hair?
An old friend of mine.
What, like an ex?
Yes, an ex. River asked Vastra for the exact words. What were they?
The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It is discovered. Doctor?
Sorry. And it was Trenzalore? Definitely Trenzalore?
Yeah.
Oh dear. Sorry.
Well?
Trenzalore. I've heard the name, of course. Dorium mentioned it. A few others. Always suspected what it was, never wanted to find out myself.
River would know, though. River always knew.
Right, come here. Give me your hand. Now, the coordinates you saw will still be in your memory. I'm linking you into the Tardis telepathic circuit. Won't hurt a bit.
Ow!
I lied.
Okay, what is Trenzalore? Is that your big secret?
No.
Okay, what then?
When you are a time traveller, there is one place you must never go. One place in all of space and time you must never, ever find yourself.
Where?
You didn't listen, did you? You lot never do. That's the problem. The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It is discovered.
He wasn't talking about my secret. No, no, no, that's not what's been found. He was talking about my grave. Trenzalore is where I'm buried.
How can you have a grave?
Because we all do, somewhere out there in the future, waiting for us.
The trouble with time travel, you can actually end up visiting.
But you're not going to. You just said it's the one place you must never go.
I have to save Vastra and Strax. Jenny too, if it's still possible. They, they cared for me during the dark times. Never questioned me, never judged me, they were just kind. I owe them. I have a duty.
No point in telling you this is too dangerous.
None at all. How can we save them?
Apparently, by breaking into my own tomb.
What's that?
She's just figured out where we're going. She's against it. I'm about to cross my own timeline in the biggest way possible. The Tardis doesn't like it. She's fighting it. Hang on! Hang on!
Now what?
She doesn't want to land. She's shut down.
So we're not there?
We must be close.
Okay, so that's where I end up.
Always thought maybe I'd retire. Take up watercolours or bee-keeping, or something. Apparently not.
So, how do we get down there? Jump?
Don't be silly. We fall.
She's turned off practically everything, except the anti-gravs. Guess what I'm turning off.
Oops.
You okay? You're visiting your own grave. Anyone would be scared.
It's more than that. I'm a time traveller. I've probably time-travelled more than anyone else.
Meaning?
Meaning my grave is potentially the most dangerous place in the universe. Shall we?
Gravestones are a bit basic?
It's a battlefield graveyard. My final battle.
Why are some of them bigger?
They're soldiers. The bigger the gravestone, the higher the rank.
It's a hell of a monument.
It's the Tardis.
I can see that.
No. When a Tardis is dying, sometimes the dimension dams start breaking down. They used to call it a size leak. All the bigger on the inside starts leaking to the outside. It grows.
When I say that's the Tardis, I don't mean it looks like the Tardis, I mean it actually is the Tardis. My Tardis from the future. What else would they bury me in?
Clara. Don't speak, don't say my name. He can't see or hear me. Only you can.
Well, come on, then.
We're mentally linked. It's the conference call. I kept the line open.
Who are you talking to? We need to get... River.
[HE SEES RIVER SONG'S GRAVESTONE.]
That can't be right.
No, it can't.
She's not dead.
Oh, she's dead, I'm afraid. She's been dead for a very long time.
Yeah, probably should have mentioned that. Never the right time.
But I met her.
Long story. But her grave can't be here.
Doctor!
This man must fall as all men must. The fate of all is always dust.
If it isn't my gravestone, then what is it?
What do you think that gravestone really is?
The gravestone?
Maybe it's a false grave...
Maybe it's a false grave.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb.
Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb!
Yes, of course. Makes sense. They'd never bury my wife out here.
Your what?
The man who lies will lie no more when this man lies at Trenzalore.
This base is surrounded! Lay down your weapons and your deaths will be merciful!
Jenny. Jenny!
This planet is now property of the Sontaran Empire. Surrender your women and intellectuals.
Strax, please! She's dead.
No heart beat. Complete cardio-collapse, shock induced.
Get her back for me. Get her back for me now or I will cut you into pieces.
Unhand me, ridiculous reptile.
There we go. Just a standard electro-cardio restart. She'll be fine.
Are you all right, my love? Can you hear me?
The heart is a relatively simple thing.
I have not found it to be so.
I see you have repaired your pet. No matter. I was only attracting your attention. I presume I have it.
Doctor Simeon. This is not possible.
And yet here we are, meeting again, so very far from home.
But he died. You told me.
Simeon died, but the creature that possessed him lived on. I take it I am now talking to the Great Intelligence?
Welcome to the final resting place of the cruel tyrant. Of the slaughterer of the ten billion, and the vessel of the final darkness. Welcome to the tomb of the Doctor.
Where are we?
Catacombs.
I hate catacombs. So how come I met your dead wife?
Oh well, you know how it is when you lose someone close to you. I sort of made a back-up.
I died saving him. In return, he saved me to a database in the biggest library in the universe. Left me like a book on a shelf. Didn't even say goodbye. He doesn't like endings.
Clara, come on! Run, run!
It was a minor skirmish, by the Doctor's blood-soaked standards. Not exactly the Time War, but enough to finish him. In the end, it was too much for the old man.
Blood-soaked?
The Doctor has been many things, but never blood-soaked.
Tell that to the leader of the Sycorax, or Solomon the trader, or the Cybermen, or the Daleks. The Doctor lives his life in darker hues, day upon day, and he will have other names before the end. The Storm, the Beast, the Valeyard.
Even if any of this were true, which I take the liberty of doubting, how did you come by this information?
I am information.
You were a mind without a body last time we met.
And you were supposed to stay that way.
Alas, I did. As you can see.
Come on, quickly, we're in.
Doctor!
Clara!
Yowzah.
Still a bit of a climb. I think I remember the way. Clara? Clara.
Hey, it's okay. You're fine. The dimensioning forces this deep in the Tardis, they can make you a bit giddy.
I know, I know. How do I know? How do I know that?
Clara, it's okay. You're fine.
Have we, have we done this before? We have. We have done this before. Climbing through a wrecked Tardis.
You said things, things I'm not supposed to remember.
We can't do this now. The Tardis is a ruin. The telepathic circuits are awakening memories you shouldn't even have.
Why do I keep meeting you?
Clara.
The Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck and she died saving my life. And she was you.
Clara.
In Victorian London there was a governess, who was really a barmaid, and she died. And she was you.
Clara? Clara, what's wrong?
What do you mean, you keep meeting me? You said I died. How could I die?
That is not a conversation you should even remember.
What do you mean I died?
The girl who died he tried to save. She'll die again inside his grave.
Run. Run!
The doors require a key. The key is a word. And the word is the Doctor's.
Here I am, late to my own funeral. Glad you could make it. Jenny.
Open the door, Doctor. Speak, and open your tomb.
No.
Because you know what's in there?
I will not open those doors.
The key is a word lost to time. A secret hidden in the deepest shadow and know to you alone. The answer to a question.
I will not open my tomb.
Doctor, what is your name? The Doctor's friends. Stop their hearts.
Madam, boys, combat formation. They are unarmed.
So are we!
Do not divulge our military secrets.
Stop this. Leave them alone.
Your name, Doctor. Answer me.
Doctor?
Do you want me to do that again?
Doctor who?
Please, stop it.
Doctor who?!
Unhand me, sir. Argh.
Leave him alone. Let him be.
Don't worry, sir. I think I've got him rattled.
Doctor! Doctor!
Doctor who?
Please!
The Tardis can still hear me. Lucky thing, since him indoors is being so useless.
Why did you open the door, sir? I had them on the run.
I didn't do it. I didn't say my name.
No, but I did.
Is everyone all right? Is everyone okay? Clara? Clara? Clara, are you okay?
That was not nice.
I know. I'm sorry. Now then, Doctor Simeon, or Mister G Intelligence, whatever I call you, do you know what's in there?
For me, peace at last. For you, pain everlasting. Won't you invite us in?
What's that?
What were you expecting, a body? Bodies are boring. I've had loads of them. Nah, that's not what my tomb is for.
But what is the light?
It's beautiful.
Should I destroy it?
Shut up, Strax.
Doctor, explain. What is that?
The tracks of my tears.
Less poetry, Doctor. Just tell them.
Time travel is damage. It's like a tear in the fabric of reality. That is the scar tissue of my journey through the universe. My path through time and space from Gallifrey to Trenzalore.
Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension?
Do I have the right?
Daleks, Cybermen, they're still in the nursery compared to us.
There are corners of the universe that have bred the most dangerous things.
You were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
I'm the Doctor. I'm from Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous
Hello, Stonehenge!
My own personal time tunnel. All the days,
It was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen.
Even the ones that I, er, even the ones that I haven't lived yet.
Doctor. Doctor!
No, no. Which is why I shouldn't be here. The paradoxes. It's very bad.
No. No. No. What are you doing? Somebody stop him!
The Doctor's life is a open wound. And an open wound can be entered.
No, it would destroy you.
Not at all. It will kill me. It will destroy you. I can rewrite your every living moment. I can turn every one of you victories into defeats. Poison every friendship. Deliver pain to your every breath.
It will burn you up. Once you go through, you can't come back. You will be scattered along my timeline like confetti.
It matters not, Doctor. You thwarted me at every turn. Now you will give me peace, as I take my revenge on every second of your life. Goodbye. Goodbye, Doctor.
What's wrong with him? What's happening?
He's being rewritten. Simeon is attacking his entire timeline. He's dying all at once. The Dalek Asylum. Androzani.
What did you say? Did you say the Dalek Asylum?
Now he's dying in London, with us.
It is done.
Oh, dear Goddess.
What's wrong?
A universe without the Doctor. There will be consequences. Jenny, with me.
The Dalek Asylum. You said it was me that saved you. How? Victorian London. How, how could I have been in Victorian London?
No. Please, stop. My life, my whole life is burning.
What are you scanning for?
Local star systems.
Why?
Because they're disappearing.
Disappearing how?
The Doctor's timeline has been corrupted. His every victory reversed. Think how many lives that man saved. How many worlds. He saved your life when we met. Jenny?
Please, Jenny, no! Oh God, oh please, no.
Reptile scum.
You are an affront to Sontaran purity. Prepare to perish!
We're friends. Strax, your past is changing, but I swear, we are comrades!
Die, reptile.
Strax! Strax!
I have to go in there.
Please, please, no.
But this is what I've already done. You've already seen me do it. I'm the Impossible Girl, and this is why.
Whatever you're thinking of doing, don't.
If I step in there, what happens?
The time winds will tear you into a million pieces. A million versions of you, living and dying all over time and space, like echoes.
But the echoes could save the Doctor, right?
But they won't be you. The real you will die. They'll just be copies.
But they'll be real enough to save him. It's like my mum said. The soufflé isn't the soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe. It's the only way to save him, isn't it?
The stars are going out. And Jenny and Strax are dead. There must be something we can do.
Well, how about that? I'm soufflé girl after all.
No. Please.
If this works, get out of here as fast as you can. And spare me a thought now and then.
No, Clara.
In fact, you know what? Run. Run, you clever boy, and remember me.
No. Clara!
I don't know where I am.
Clara!
I just know I'm running. Sometimes it's like I've lived a thousand lives in a thousand places. I'm born, I live, I die.
And always, there's the Doctor. Always I'm running to save the Doctor again and again and again. Oi! And he hardly ever hears me. But I've always been there.
Doctor?
Yes, what is it? What do you want?
Right from the very beginning.
Sorry, but you're about to make a very big mistake. Don't steal that one, steal this one. The navigation system's knackered, but you'll have much more fun.
Right from the day he started running.
Run, you clever boy.
And remember me.
It was an unprovoked and violent attack, but that's no excuse.
We're all restored. That's all that matters now.
We are not all restored.
You can't go in there. It's your own time stream, for God's sake.
I have to get her back.
Of course, but not like this.
But how?
Is she still alive? It killed Doctor Simeon.
Clara's got one advantage over the Great Intelligence.
Which is?
Me.
Doctor, please listen to me. At least hear me.
Now, if I don't come back, and I might not...
Doctor!
Go to the Tardis. The fast return protocols should be on. She'll take you home, then shut herself down.
There has to be another way. Use the Tardis, use something. Save her, yes, but for God's sake be sensible.

How are you even doing that? I'm not really here.
You are always here to me. And I always listen, and I can always see you.
Then why didn't you speak to me?
Because I thought it would hurt too much.
I believe I could have coped.
No, I thought it would hurt me. And I was right.
[THE DOCTOR KISSES RIVER.]
Since nobody else in this room can see you, God knows how that looked.
There is a time to live and a time to sleep. You are an echo, River.
Like Clara. Like all of us, in the end. My fault, I know, but you should've faded by now.
It's hard to leave when you haven't said goodbye.
Then tell me, because I don't know. How do I say it?
There's only one way I'd accept. If you ever loved me, say it like you're going to come back.
Well, then. See you around, Professor River Song.
Till the next time, Doctor.
Don't wait up.
Oh, there's one more thing.
Isn't there always?
I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, then how can I still be here?
Okay, how?
Spoilers. Goodbye, sweetie.
I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going or where I've been. I was born to save the Doctor, but the Doctor is safe now. I'm the Impossible Girl, and my story is done.
Doctor?
Doctor! Please, please, I don't know where I am.
Clara. You can hear me. I know you can.
I can't see you.
I'm everywhere. You're inside my time stream. Everything around you is me.
I can see you.
All your different faces, they're here.
Those are my ghosts. My past. Every good day, every bad day.
What's wrong? What's happening?
I'm inside my own time stream. It's collapsing in on itself.
Well, get out then.
Not until I've got you.
I don't even know who I am.
You're my Impossible Girl. I'm sending you something. Not from my past, from yours. Look up. Look.
This is you, Clara. Everything you were or will be. Take it. You blew into the world on this leaf. Hold tight. It will take you home.
Clara! Clara! Come on. Come on, to me, now.
You can do it. I know you can.
How?
Because it's impossible. And you're my Impossible Girl. How many times have you saved me, Clara? Just this once, just for the hell of it, let me save you. You have to trust me, Clara. I'm real. Just one more step.
Clara, my Clara.
Who's that?
Never mind. Let's go back.
But who is he?
He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back.
But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. Eleven faces, all of them you. You're the eleventh Doctor.
I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor.
I don't understand.
Look, my name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise.
Clara? Clara? Clara!
He is my secret.
What I did, I did without choice.
I know.
In the name of peace and sanity.
But not in the name of the Doctor.
